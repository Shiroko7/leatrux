# Crafting Rules

**1. Proficiency and Tools:**

- The character must be proficient with a smith's tools and have access to a forge or appropriate workspace.

**2. Formula and Materials:**

- A character must have a blueprint or design for the item. They also need the required materials, which can include specific metals, rocks, gems, and elemental components, depending on the item’s rarity.

**3. Crafting Process:**

- Forging a weapon or armor involves smelting, shaping, and tempering the materials over a period of time. The time required depends on the item’s rarity.

|Item Rarity|Crafting Time|
|---|---|
|Common|3 days|
|Uncommon|2 workweeks|
|Rare|3 workweeks|
|Very Rare|4 workweeks|
|Legendary|6 workweeks|

**4. Checks:**

- At the end of the crafting process, the character may need to make a Strength check or an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) check, depending on the DM's discretion. This check determines the quality of the item and whether any complications arise.
