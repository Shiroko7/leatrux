# Crafting Rules

**1. Proficiency and Tools:**

- The character must be proficient with an herbalism kit and have access to a workspace.

**2. Formula and Ingredients:**

- A character must have a formula for the potion. They also need the necessary ingredients, which can sometimes involve special or rare components.

**3. Crafting Process:**

- Crafting a potion involves mixing ingredients and brewing them over a period of time. The time required depends on the potion's rarity.

| Potion Rarity | Crafting Time |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Common        | 1 day         |
| Uncommon      | 1 workweek    |
| Rare          | 2 workweeks   |
| Very Rare     | 3 workweeks   |
| Legendary     | 4 workweeks   |

**4. Checks:**

- At the end of the crafting process, the character may need to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check or a Wisdom (Medicine) check, depending on the DM's discretion. This check determines the quality of the potion and whether any complications arise.
