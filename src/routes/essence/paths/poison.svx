**Abilities:**
- **Venomous Touch:** As an action, you can imbue your touch with a mild poison. A creature you touch must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become poisoned for 1 minute.

- **Herbalist’s Knowledge:** You gain proficiency with the Medicine skill and advantage on checks to identify or use medicinal herbs and poisons.
- **Elixir of Vitality:** As a bonus action, you can consume a special elixir to regain hit dice. You regain a number of hit dice equal to half your proficiency bonus (minimum of one). You can use this ability once per long rest.
- **Strength Booster:** You can drink a mutagen to gain advantage on Strength-based ability checks and saving throws for 10 minutes. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus to Strength-based attack rolls during this time. You can use this ability once per short or long rest.
- **Quickening Draught:** By drinking a specially prepared potion, you gain an additional 10 feet of movement speed for 1 hour and advantage on Dexterity-based ability checks. This effect can be used once per short or long rest.
- **Enchanting Perfume**: As an action, you can apply a specially crafted perfume that enhances your charm and charisma. For the next hour, you gain a 1d4 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Deception) checks against humanoids. You can use this effect on a creature once per long rest.
