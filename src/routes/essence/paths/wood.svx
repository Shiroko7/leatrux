_Each ability costs 1 talent point_

**Abilities:**
- **Vine Manipulation:** You gain the ability to manipulate vines and roots within 30 feet of you. As an action, you can cause vines to emerge from the ground or surrounding vegetation to ensnare a creature or create barriers. The vines can grapple or restrain a creature (Strength saving throw) or create difficult terrain in a 10-foot square area for 1 minute.
- **Verdant Armor**: As an action, you can envelop yourself in a protective layer of magically enhanced bark and vines. For the next hour, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you have resistance to bludgeoning, slashing and piercing damage. 
- **Fertile Ground Resilience**: When you are standing on or above fertile soil (such as grasslands, forests, or similar natural terrain), you can use your reaction to gain immunity to effects that would knock you prone or push you away. Additionally, while on such terrain, you gain advantage on saving throws against being grappled or restrained.
- **Thorny Defence:** When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to cause thorns to erupt from your skin. The attacker takes 1d4 piercing damage. This ability’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th Adept level (2d4), 9th Master level (3d4), 13th Grandmaster level (4d4), and 17th Great-grandmaster level (5d4).
-  **Woodcraft:** You gain proficiency with woodcarver’s tools and the ability to craft simple wooden items. You can create small wooden objects (e.g., a carved figurine, a simple tool) in 1 hour, provided you have access to suitable materials. You can also use your tools to make minor repairs to wooden objects.

- **Plant Bond:** You can communicate with plants in a basic way. You understand their emotions and can ask simple questions (e.g., "Where is the nearest source of water?"). Plants can also provide you with basic information about their immediate surroundings.
- **Woodland Stride:** Moving through nonmagical plant life, such as undergrowth or vines, costs you no extra movement. You can also move through difficult terrain caused by plant life without penalty.
- **Nature’s Insight:** You gain proficiency in Nature and Survival skills. If you are already proficient in either of these skills, you gain expertise, doubling your proficiency bonus for those skills.
