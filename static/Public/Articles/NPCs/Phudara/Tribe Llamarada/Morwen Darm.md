Morwen stands as the supreme elder of the [[Tribe Llamarada]], serving as their second pillar of fire. Following the death of her husband [[Gaeanor Darm]], the former pillar of earth, in a tragic incident at the [[Infernoheart Citadel]], she assumed the honorary title of fire pillar despite only reaching the quasi-nascent soul realm. Through [[Talon Scorch]]'s guidance, she attained the power necessary to shoulder the tribe's need for a supreme elder. In the wake of these events, her daughter [[Rachel Darm]] ascended as the tribe's holy daughter, while Morwen herself grew more cold and reserved, her warmth diminished by the loss of her husband.
