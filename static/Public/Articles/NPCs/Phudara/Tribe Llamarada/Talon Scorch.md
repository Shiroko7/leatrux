Talon Scorch, the eldest member of the [[Tribe Llamarada]], once led the tribe as its patriarch and primary pillar of fire. A chosen survivor of the trial of fire, his triumph elevated him to legendary status within the tribe. Though he has since passed the mantle of leadership, he continues to share the responsibilities of the fire pillar with [[Morwen Darm]], his influence and renown undiminished by time.
