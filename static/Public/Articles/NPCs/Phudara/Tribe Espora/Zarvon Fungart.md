[[Zarvon]], sovereign of the [[Tribe Espora]], stands at the pinnacle of cultivation on the island, though his mind has long since begun to fracture. A former chosen of the trials of fire, his current mastery over spores brings terror to many, as rumors persist of his ability to control the minds of those who inhale themâ€”a threat magnified by his capacity to spread these spores across the entire island. Once a figure of calculated authority, his behavior now swings wildly between lucidity and madness. In his declining years, he has focused his remaining clarity on doting upon his granddaughter [[Laura Bush]], perhaps seeking to preserve some fragment of his former self through her.
