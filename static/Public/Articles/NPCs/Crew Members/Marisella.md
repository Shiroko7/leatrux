Marisella, a half-elf cleric of [[Lathender]] and healer of the [[Fulh'ulbrech]], was eventually revealed to be the daughter of [[Lathender]] during the events of [[Harpy's Sincerity]]. Her faith came to light during [[The Ghosts of the Sea]]. Her ambitious dreams included becoming one of the strongest adventurers while repopulating the planet with children of her faith. Though she met her end at the hands of [[Mu Youqing]] during [[Team Magma's Journey]], she was later revived during the events of [[The Surgery]].
