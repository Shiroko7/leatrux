In the seas of Amaterra lurks an ancient evil - Umberlee, the Queen of the Depths, though she's more commonly known to sailors as the Bitch Queen. While most gods have faded from the world's memory, her malevolent influence continues to manifest in nature itself. Sailors and seafarers still whisper her name in fear, offering prayers not out of devotion, but desperate hope to appease her destructive whims.

Stories tell of her supernatural powers over weather and sea creatures, who bow before her might. Those fortunate enough to survive encounters with her all share the same description - a deranged and malicious entity who delights in chaos. Her reputation as the Bitch Queen is well-earned; she is known for her pettiness, greed, and vanity, drowning ships and their crews on mere caprice.

Her true nature was exposed during the events of The Ghosts of the Sea, where she had been disguising herself as "Emberlee," sabotaging expeditions and causing maritime disasters for her own amusement. Despite the world's general loss of faith, Umberlee stands as a dark reminder that some ancient powers still hold sway over the realms of [[Amaterra]], and her infamous title continues to be whispered with fear across every port and vessel.
