This hidden isle lies in the deep southern reaches of [[Phudara]]. In truth, it is an artificially segregated landmass, created by [[Phudara]], the emerald dragon. Long ago, she clashed with two powerful adversaries—[[Retharax]], the origin red dragon, and [[Vyrelaxan]], the origin green dragon. Outmatched and at a severe disadvantage, [[Phudara]] used her cunning to deceive her foes, managing to kill [[Vyrelaxan]] and seal [[Retharax]] on this very island.

For years, the world believed the conflict to be resolved, with [[Phudara]] retreating into deep seclusion. But in reality, the scheming and rivalry among these dragons are far from over. [[Retharax]] is slowly healing, plotting his escape and revenge. Meanwhile, [[Phudara]], still recovering from her own wounds, has taken every measure to prevent his return. She brought life to the island, populating it with elves who grew into thriving tribes. These tribes now compete with one another, cultivating the legacy of [[Amaterra]] under [[Phudara]]’s subtle influence, all as part of her long-term strategy to contain [[Retharax]] and uncover his plans.

Now, [[Retharax]] is on the verge of awakening, and [[Vyrelaxan]]'s noble house has somehow managed to infiltrate the island from the outside. The machinations of these two dragons continue, their plots aimed at toppling [[Phudara]] and reclaiming what they believe is theirs.
