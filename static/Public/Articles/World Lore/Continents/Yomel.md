Yomel is the continent ruled by an arrogant blue dragon god who dwells in the highest mountains, far removed from civilization. He commands an army of dragons that control the continent and enslave its inhabitants as their workforce.

The environment of Yomel is harsh and resource-poor, with poverty widespread and survival a constant challenge. These conditions have forced its inhabitants to adapt, developing into one of the most unique and commercially advanced civilizations.

Monsters and dangers lurk throughout the desert, making trade routes treacherous. Caravans require expert guides who understand the land to successfully transport goods. People aspire to join elite merchant guilds or become their mercenary protectors.

Due to these harsh conditions, dark practices for survival have become common across the continent. Most try to form warlock pacts with dragons for power and protection. Those who cannot achieve such pacts turn to worshipping other hidden deities of the desert.
