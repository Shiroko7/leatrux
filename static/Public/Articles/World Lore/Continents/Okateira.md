This is a continent inhabited primarily by humanoid animals, where different species live in segregated tribes. Prejudice, racism and xenophobia runs deep here between species. These tribes don't get along and are frequently in conflict with each other.

According to legends, great wars were fought to gain the favor of dragons. In these lands, the fiercest warriors earn dragon approval, which means not just survival, but also resources and pride.

The dragon god of this continent is Okateira, a mercury dragon whose nature is completely bizarre and chaotic. This dragon is said to have two heads that are constantly in conflict with each other. The dragon favors animals over dragonborn and other species.

There are hundreds of stories about Okateira's unpredictable nature - one day performing miraculous healings and bestowing blessings, the next day consuming entire villages on a whim. Parents discipline their children by saying Okateira will appear and eat them if they misbehave.
