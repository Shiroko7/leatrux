According to legend, the mountains of this continent were created and sculpted by the diamond dragon god, Imia. These mountains have peculiar shapes and are rich with precious minerals, a gift from the creator dragon god to the inhabitants of this land. It is said that the World Tree found here is the tomb of Imia, giving life to the entire continent.

Imia is a vast continent with an immense population of non-dragons. Most people live their lives unaware of the ongoing conflict among their true lords. In fact, the majority of villages believe that magic is a myth and that dragons are nothing more than legends or part of a reptilian conspiracy theory.

The inhabitants of these lands are caught in constant political conflicts and rivalries between feudal landowners, which are, in reality, games played to resolve disputes among dragons. These dragons, though numerous, live secretly among the people.

Those who are aware of this truth bear [[Dragonmark |dragonmarks]] on their bodies, signs of their knowledge and connection to the hidden reality of this mysterious world.
