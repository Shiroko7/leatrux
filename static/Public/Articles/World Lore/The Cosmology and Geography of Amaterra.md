[[Amaterra]] is divided into eight main continents, each named after and ruled by its founding dragon. These dragons are:

- **Leatrux**, the lawful platinum dragon
- **Sirius**, the perseverant white dragon
- **Phudara**, the cunning emerald dragon
- **Okateira**, the chaotic mercury dragon
- **Aildrieg**, the benevolent silver dragon
- **Yomel**, the tyrant blue dragon
- **Reonna**, the reclusive yellow dragon
- **Imia**, the powerful adamantine dragon

Over the course of history, these continents have shifted and changed—sometimes in shape, sometimes in rulers. Some continents have been created, while others have fallen into ruin. This ever-changing landscape makes traveling across the world a complex endeavor.

Additionally, because [[Amaterra]] is an exoplanet influenced by the pull of fate, it is not bound to a single solar system. It exists independently of any galaxy, and the forces from other systems can only momentarily affect its trajectory. No one knows the true direction in which Amaterra is heading.

This uncertainty extends to the starry sky above. It is constantly in flux, with the number of moons and suns varying over time. As a result, navigation is a constant challenge—calculations must be adjusted after each period as the sky and the planet itself change.
