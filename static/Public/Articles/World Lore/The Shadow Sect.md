The origins of the Shadow Sect remain shrouded in mystery, but it is known to your a party that [[Phudara]] serves as the current acting leader of the sect on [[Amaterra]]. Their singular objective is monumental: to create a portal connecting the [[Feywild]] and [[Shadowfell]], thus bringing the laws of life and death to this world. By achieving this, they hope to save all the remnant souls trapped on [[Amaterra]], allowing them to rejoin the cycle of rebirth.

Among the sect's ranks is [[Harpy]], the self-proclaimed Saintess of the Shadow Sect. She oversees the island, ensuring the sect's objectives are advanced. All sect members hail from the [[Isle of Whispers]], chosen through the grueling Trial of Fires. Those who pass this test become "seeds," earning the rank of external disciples. Only those who further prove themselves by earning [[Harpy]]'s approval can transcend the island and rise to the status of internal disciples.

These internal disciples journey across [[Amaterra]], undertaking various missions to advance the sect's ultimate goal. As the Shadow Sect grows in influence and power, its presence looms ever larger over the world, poised to shape the fate of [[Amaterra]] itself.
