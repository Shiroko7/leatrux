## Escaping to the Third Stage

After Mu Youqing's devastating display of power forced a retreat, each character faced defining moments that would shape their paths forward:

Thallassios, having been thrown far from the battle with the Frostreaver lost among the animated branches, faced a critical choice. The easy path to safety lay before him, but it would mean abandoning Selune and the blade forever. Despite Selune's own insistence that he prioritize his survival, Thallassios chose to fight his way back through the grasping vegetation. His decision was driven not by pride or duty, but by the genuine bond they had forged. Though he emerged from this ordeal looking somewhat foolish compared to the battle's stronger combatants, he maintained his connection with Selune and the Frostreaver without suffering the severe consequences that could have befallen him.

Herng's moment of truth came when he witnessed Marisella in mortal danger. Having recently experienced death and resurrection himself, he initially froze, almost choosing to flee alone. Harpy's presence offered no comfort, as she showed clear reluctance to help and seemed preoccupied with other concerns. It took the distant but palpable disapproval of Lathander to finally spur Herng to action. In a moment of desperate courage, he forced Harpy to serve as a power source for his map against her will. This action revealed far more than expected – the entire continent of Phudara appeared on the map, unleashing unprecedented power that allowed him to save Marisella through the combined force of maps and stars.

Laura found herself struggling alongside Lumina and Wang on her flying broom. Their escape was repeatedly complicated by Wang, who seemed to actively make their situation worse at every turn. When things appeared most dire, Lumina revealed a darker side of her abilities, producing a magical staff to control others as living shields during their escape. The situation took a bitter turn when Wang, after regaining consciousness and receiving Laura's own broom, chose to abandon them despite his grand promises of return and rescue. Moments later, a devastating cone of cold attack left Laura unconscious. In this state, she encountered Ardathian, the giant copper dragon residing within her dragonmark. The dragon offered his power in exchange for a weighty promise – Laura would have to kill Okateira, the origin dragon responsible for Ardathian's death. This pact would have far-reaching implications for her future.

Nilo's escape alongside Lime took a dire turn when they found themselves cornered by Mu Youqing's clone. Though weakened from the previous battle, it was still an overwhelming force that nearly crushed Nilo effortlessly. In this moment of desperation, a spirit suddenly emerged from Lime's body – her grandfather, a powerful expert whom she had been carrying within her. With the dignified demeanor of an old master, he engaged the clone in combat, using the last of his strength to hold it at bay. Before sacrificing himself to ensure their escape, he bestowed upon them a heart-crushing technique and bid a final farewell to Lime.

When confronted with this gifted power, Nilo experienced an epiphany from beyond the void, transforming the heart-crushing technique into a heart-consuming one. Their path of survival seemed set on a dark course until Serenella Sunflare, a familiar face to Nilo, appeared attempting to organize an orderly escape. This moment offered a potential turning point, but Lime's inability to contain her bloodlust led to her attacking Serenella. Despite Nilo's attempts to de-escalate the situation and others trying to intervene, he failed to persuade Lime to stop. The situation reached its tragic climax when Lime began breaking through to the adept level, defying the heavens by consuming Serenella. This left Nilo with no choice but to continue their bloody path to survival, though the weight of these actions and sacrifices would surely haunt him.

Gio's escape took an unexpected turn when he found himself hindered by flying puppets that seemed strangely attracted to his presence. Seeing others in need of help but doubting his ability to save them alone, he experienced a surprising intervention. His snake, Lollipop, spoke to him, describing the righteous path as one bound by chains that could only be broken through greater strength. Following the snake's suggestion to use an enlarge spell, Gio transformed into a mythical Xuanwu turtle. This new form allowed him to save numerous lives by carrying others to safety on his back. However, unbeknownst to Gio, Lollipop's encouraging words about heroism and taking full responsibility for everyone's safety were motivated more by calculating self-interest than genuine concern for others' well-being. The snake cleverly masked its greed behind calls for the greater good, setting up a dynamic that would influence their relationship going forward.
