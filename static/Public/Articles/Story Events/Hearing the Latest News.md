As [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] wandered through the transformed streets of [[Tribe Lluvia]], they could hardly recognize their surroundings. Where once stood austere buildings now bustled with new construction, and the previously rare sight of male cultivators had become commonplace. Most striking was the unprecedented number of couples openly displaying affection – a dramatic shift from the tribe's traditionally rigid social structure.

Their path led them to the medical ward, where they sought news of the survivors from the [[The Incels|incels incident]]. There, they found [[Connie]], now a volunteer, who eagerly shared the latest developments. With a conspiratorial lean forward, she revealed that beyond the controversial integration of the [[Liberation Sect]], two major events had rocked all three tribes during their absence.

First, she spoke of the mysterious magical item thief who had expanded their territory, striking both the [[Tribe Llamarada]] and [[Tribe Espora]]. Rumors swirled like autumn leaves – some whispered of a curse, others of an evil spirit, and a few even suggested a hidden ancestor prowling in the shadows. Yet as mysteriously as the thefts had escalated, they had suddenly ceased.

Her voice took on a tone of barely concealed amusement as she recounted the second event: the great healing potion scandal. [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]]'s masters, [[Elira]] and [[Vanya]], had apparently turned their ambassadorial positions into a profitable venture, marketing "variations" of healing potions across the tribes. These concoctions, laced with additives and mild narcotics, had created quite a dependent customer base – and quite the controversy. When the other tribes discovered the manipulation, they demanded both the genuine recipe and the masters' resignations. True to form, [[Elira]] and [[Vanya]] had simply sold the recipe and walked away with their considerable profits intact.

As [[Connie]] concluded her updates, she remembered one final message: [[Durim Stonehammer]] awaited their return at the Ship, his business apparently too urgent to be delayed by tribal politics.
