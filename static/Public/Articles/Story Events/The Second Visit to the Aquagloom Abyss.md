# The Second Visit to the Aquagloom Abyss

The party of six ventured deep into the Aquagloom Abyss, guided by Thallassios's mysterious connection to voices calling from its depths. Their first night of camp was disrupted by an attack from pistol shrimps led by Tony "Snapper" Lobsterini, who after the skirmish attempted to recruit them into a war against Tommy "Hammer" Mantis's punch shrimps. Despite the offer of electrum, the party remained neutral in this underwater gang conflict.

Descending to the second layer, they chose the middle path of three, discovering ancient ruins of a sea goddess's church. There, they encountered a group of sirens led by Umberlith, alongside her sisters Cassandra, Cerys, Velary, and Nyxara. The meeting quickly turned hostile when the sirens, followers of Emberlee, were overwhelmed by an inexplicable urge to attack Nilo. After a fierce battle that nearly claimed Nilo's life, they defeated Umberlith, ending the conflict. The sirens explained their centuries-long existence, sustained by a powerful deva corpse through cycles of death and rebirth. The goat, excited by this discovery, began consuming the deva's remains, unleashing powerful curses that forced everyone to evacuate, leaving only the unconscious Umberlith behind.

Bewildered and cursed, the party and the remaining sirens explored further into the abyss, eventually becoming lost in a vast, eerily peaceful region. Seeking guidance, Herng contacted Harpy, who provided specific coordinates and explicitly ordered them to wait there for her assistance. However, upon reaching the location and discovering a massive vortex, the party made the fateful decision to jump in rather than wait as instructed. This choice split the group tragically apart. Cassandra perished first, while Nilo, Gio, Lime, and Velarya struggled for survival on one side. Nilo fell unconscious but was saved by consuming a siren's heart, with Lime later refining another siren's remains into a nourishing pill. This group later encountered a wind path martial artist's inheritance trial, which proved too challenging, forcing them to promise a future return.

Laura's group faced a different fate, as she, Cerys, and Nyxara were dragged through treacherous currents for days. Swallowed by a whale, they lost Cerys to exhaustion. Laura and Nyxara found themselves on a strange tropical island with an alien sky, where they discovered another siren's corpse—Seo Nari—revealing a political assassination that Nyxara vowed to avenge. Laura spent what felt like a year on the island before being suddenly teleported back for the Trial of Fire.

Herng, separated from the others, was retrieved by Harpy, who questioned the party's decision to enter the vortex rather than wait for her aid. With the Trial of Fire approaching, the survivors rushed to address their accumulated curses. Nilo and Gio received treatment from Vanya, while Herng paid a hefty sum to the Shadowflame clan matriarch, Talia, who requested he watch over her son Nerion during the trial.
