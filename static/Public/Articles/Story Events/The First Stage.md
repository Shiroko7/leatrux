# The First Stage
## The Elemental Chaos

The trial's first phase challenged initiates to navigate through a barrier into a wood path world, one of the nine great essences. Chaos erupted immediately when a massive explosion within the Lluvia tribe killed a dozen members and wounded many more. As the groups fought and gathered essences, several significant events unfolded:

- Thallassios acquired a powerful lightning element, disrupting a battle between Quill Rest and Laura Bush
- Nilo, Gio, and Lime confronted Velira's group, which included Tiberon, ultimately capturing Velira alive
- The espora trio narrowly survived a devastating explosion of nine essences, saved only by Lime's powerful fate
- A mysterious creature absorbed several participants, including Auron and members of the Liberation Sect, though the Nilo, Gio and Lime managed to escape. They left those behind to their own fate.
- Herng, Marisella, and Rachel eventually reunited with Nilo's group and teleported together
- Laura, Thallassios, and Lumina, severely injured after helping fight Velira and Tiberious, were forced to leave this phase early
