### Joining the Tribes

The party regroups and shares their bizarre experiences. Without a clear plan besides repairing their ship and leaving the island, they decide to visit the supreme elders of each tribe to learn more about the situation. They discover that the Lluvia tribe, previously known as the Storm tribe, lost the "right" to cultivate the lightning essence after a catastrophic event. The tribe has since transitioned to focusing on the other two essences and lost its earlier gender equality. In the Llamarada tribe, Thornor personally approaches Gio, inviting him to join the tribe as his disciple to sharpen his martial arts and overcome his cultivation bottleneck. Gio declines, preferring his drug habit, but agrees to practice with him in private. Meanwhile, in the Espora tribe, the party notices Zarvon's mental instability and moments of clarity, realizing that the other supreme elders are likely under his control, shaping the tribe's strange dynamics.

Eventually, the party members choose their paths. Laura joins the Lluvia tribe, intrigued by wind as a way to master her navigation skills. Thallassios is similarly drawn to wind, finding it fascinating as a foreign concept for a triton. Rudy joins to fish and earn money. Gio and Nilo decide on the Espora tribe, curious about its poison cultivation and mysterious atmosphere. Herng and Marisella join the Llamarada tribe, with Herng motivated to study rocks in the volcano and Marisella unwilling to leave him alone.

Each tribe provides their new initiates with basic cultivation scriptures. To become external disciples, they must complete a trial: retrieve an elemental core from their tribe's dungeon and win a duel against another candidate with a core. The dungeons are Venomshade Sanctum for the Espora tribe, Aquagloom Abyss for the Lluvia tribe, and Inferno Heart Citadel for the Llamarada tribe. Each initiate is assigned a master to supervise their trials.

In the Espora tribe, Nilo and Gio struggle after ambushing a wood elemental and are chased away by minor elementals known as "wood goblins," fleeing like startled rabbits. They are supervised by Vanya and Elira, who also serve as external relations ambassadors. Laura and Thallassios face water goblins but struggle against the water elemental, failing their trial. They are saved by Ces, the only male master in the Lluvia tribe and an external relations ambassador. Herng and Marisella, unsupervised when Morwen leaves abruptly, easily defeat fire goblins and elementals, securing two fire cores. On their way back, they are met by Rachel Darm, the Llamarada tribe's holy daughter and Morwen's daughter. Midway through their return, Rachel learns of a crisis in her tribe and rushes ahead, furious that her mother called her away to keep her safe.
