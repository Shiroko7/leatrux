### Hierarchy of Power

All three tribes follow a similar hierarchy of power, based on cultivation realms:

1. **Tribe Head**: The eldest and most powerful supreme elder, who serves as the tribeâ€™s leader.
2. **Supreme Elders**: Grandmaster-level cultivators in the "Nascent Soul Realm." Each tribe has two, except for the head.
3. **Masters**: Cultivators in the "Core Formation Realm" who serve as the foundation of the tribe's future. Each tribe has 6 to 12.
4. **Internal Disciples**: Adept-level cultivators in the "Foundation Establishment Realm." Numbering in the hundreds, they are the first line of defense.
5. **External Disciples**: Initiate-level cultivators in the "Qi Refining Realm." They make up the vast majority of cultivators, numbering in the thousands.
6. **Mortals**: Non-cultivators, forming the majority of the population, numbering in the tens of thousands.

The strength and status of individuals increase exponentially with each cultivation realm.
