# Aurelia, the Golden Temptress

After their separate escapes, the main party members found themselves reunited in a mysterious room with five paths, each leading to deadly traps. After solving an otherworldly puzzle and helping clean Gio's darkened skin, they proceeded cautiously, noting ominous warnings about greed and cursed gold along their way.

Their path led them to a chamber filled with an extraordinary amount of gold and treasure chests – enough to repair their ship multiple times over. Despite their initial wariness of the warning messages, events took an unexpected turn when Lollipop, Gio's snake companion, awoke at the scent of gold. The snake promptly awakened the room's guardian spirit and fled to safety, closing the door behind them.

The guardian revealed herself as Aurelia, the Golden Temptress, who immediately began demanding money and worship from the party in an unusual display of financial domination. While most of the party found humor in this bizarre situation, Laura remained notably irritated, refusing to either obey or offer money. The situation escalated when Aurelia summoned a mimic to attack Laura, demanding she sign a promissory note for 1,000 gold pieces as an apology.

As the confrontation unfolded, different party members took various approaches: Gio attempted to distance himself from the situation, while Nilo tried to outsmart Aurelia by signing the note with a false name (Dexter). Though initially successful, Aurelia's discovery of the deception led her to add a zero to their imaginary debt. Laura and Herng struggled to escape while the others continued to provoke Aurelia, each taunt resulting in another zero being added to the debt until it reached one million gold.

The situation changed dramatically when Lollipop returned, now disguised as a wealthy young master prince and heir to a powerful empire. The snake spirit intervened under the pretense of protecting its "little brother" Gio, wielding a golden bell that awakened greed in everyone present. Aurelia, completely fooled by the disguise, attempted to charm the supposed prince, only to be knocked unconscious when she turned her back.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, the party quickly gathered as much treasure as they could carry – each member taking a heavy chest of gold, with Nilo filling his bag of holding to capacity. They retreated to a safe distance for a short rest, hearing Aurelia's complaints from her chamber but knowing she was bound to the room as its guardian.

Finally, the group chose a random path forward, managing to overcome its traps through a combination of brute force and clever thinking, carrying their newfound wealth with them as they proceeded deeper into the trial's challenges.
