# Preparing for the Trial of Fire

As the Trial of Fire approached, the party members spent time with their respective tribes, each pursuing different paths of preparation.

## Individual Training

**Herng's Initiation** At Kaelan's dojo, Herng discovered he and Rachel were the only initiates among a group of adept-level disciples. His "welcome" consisted of several days of intense sparring sessions—or rather, systematic beatings—as the adepts took turns "training" their new companion, marking his initiation into their order.

**Laura's Advancement** Under Faelara's guidance, Laura devoted herself to mastering the arcane archer path—a unique cultivation method invented by her master through extraordinary talent. She trained alongside the adepts of her order, learning to merge archery with magical techniques.

**Gio's Martial Growth** Gio's training led him to Thornor, the Llamarada tribe's patriarch. Their sparring sessions expanded Gio's understanding of martial arts, with Thornor demonstrating seemingly limitless weapon mastery. Impressed by Gio's foreign fighting techniques, Thornor rewarded him with a substantial amount of platinum.

**Thallassios's Dangerous Path** Struggling to form a team for the trial, Thallassios fell into a trap set by Seris, one of Lady Elowen's adoptive daughters. Under the guise of training, she initiated him into dual cultivation—a taboo practice given the tribe's gender imbalance and males' low compatibility with rain essences. As rumors spread about their nightly encounters, Thallassios's progress suffered rather than improved.

**Nilo's Path to Yang Cultivation** During this period, Elira shared with Nilo five recipes for yin path method cantrips, each corresponding to the five yin organs and elements—a technique in which she excelled. However, these methods proved unsuitable for Nilo due to his male nature. When consulting with Vanya about this challenge, she suggested that cultivating yin energy typically required embracing feminine aspects. Taking inspiration from his master's early cultivation journey, Nilo is to work in solitude to develop his own equivalent methods, adapting the techniques to work with yang organs and energy more suited to his natural disposition.

**Nilo and Gio's Companion** Their masters, Vanya and Elira, bestowed powerful artifacts upon them. Vanya gave Gio a magical lollipop infused with serpent qi, sharing her own experiences with it during past trials while warning them about the Serpentsoul clan's aggressive marriage proposals. Elira presented Nilo with a rare reincarnation amulet, expressing her concern for his safety.

**Team Formation**

Their masters recommended several potential teammates:

- Vaelith: Arcane trickster of the poison path
- Verdis: Wood path ranger
- Ronan: Poison path ranger
- Thalion Swiftblade: Wood and sword path ranger
- Thunder: Wood path ranger and druid beastmaster
- Lime: Wood path druid
- Laura Bush: Though not recommended, possessed powerful artifacts

Nilo and Gio ultimately chose Lime, a druid with healing capabilities and charming look. With Vanya's help, they impressed her by demonstrating Gio's ability to consume poison cores effortlessly. Though Lime feigned amazement (unbeknownst to them), she agreed to join their team.

## Final Preparations

The party regrouped with Marisella and Lime for one final expedition into the Aquagloom Abyss, having acquired the necessary magical items and materials for extended underwater exploration. This venture would serve as their last preparation before the upcoming trial.
