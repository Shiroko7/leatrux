[[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]'s second breakthrough attempt proceeded with even far greater care than her first. The tribe allocated abundant resources, gathering numerous cultivators to both assist with her tribulation and benefit from the elemental manifestations it would attract. Supreme elders and most masters from the tribe stood in attendance, lending their prestige to the event.

[[Lumina]] and [[Wang Dabao|Juan David De la Lluvia]] positioned themselves as her dao protectors, standing close to provide immediate assistance if needed. [[Lumina]] offered reassurances of favorable fortune, while [[Wang Dabao|Juan]] pledged his life to her protection, swearing by his own name.

Heeding previous instruction, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] approached the process with deliberate patience. She gathered an impressive reservoir of spiritual energy before flawlessly breaking her dao seed. As the tribulation manifested air elementals, the assembled cultivators engaged them in battle. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] successfully absorbed the remaining energy, completing her breakthrough without requiring direct intervention from her close companions.

Meanwhile, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] leveraged his position at the medical guard to collect blood from the many wounded in the elemental battle. Finding himself alone with two critically injured cultivators, he realized he couldn't treat them both in time. Rushing to find assistance, he encountered [[Sister Mei]], who presented him with a choice—help him personally or save the wounded. Despite the opportunity to exploit the situation for additional blood samples, [[Nilo]] chose to prioritize the injured cultivators' lives.

As her ritual concluded, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] descended from the sky to the mountaintop. Her spiritual energy, at its peak, allowed her to extend her perception through the winds across the entire [[Lluvia Tribe]]. She sensed [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] swimming near the shore, freshly emerged from his seclusion.

She sought him out, accompanied by [[Lumina]], [[Wang Dabao|Juan]], and [[Nilo]]. During their reunion, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] demonstrated his newly acquired abilities—the results of his merger with the [[Frostreaver]] and his refined water clone technique. [[Nilo]] suggested that [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] participate in arena fights to showcase his skills, privately calculating how he might collect fresh blood from these bouts while simultaneously promoting passage aboard the [[Fulh'ulbrech]].
