## Passing the News to the Three Great Tribes

Upon their return to the Lluvia Tribe, the party's initial celebration as heroes was quickly overshadowed by the electric atmosphere of the battle arena. There, Quill Rest, son of Faelara and the tribe's prodigy, had been challenging sparring partners in preparation for his advancement to the adept stage. Having already claimed thirty-three consecutive victories over several days, Quill had become a sensation among the tribe members.

Thallassios, displaying his characteristic but often misplaced bravado, stepped forward to challenge Quill despite the obvious power disparity. The match proved brutally one-sided, with Thallassios suffering a devastating knockout from a single strike. Herng, taking pity on his companion, secretly aided him with healing magic between rounds, allowing Thallassios to rise for several more attempts—each ending in swift defeat. Irritated by this interference, Quill turned his challenge toward Herng, who refused to engage, earning the crowd's disapproval. While the others showed no interest in participating, Gio unexpectedly entered the fray. The ensuing match took an unusual turn when Gio employed a magical dart to confuse his opponent, but then declared the combat too tedious and left the arena—a decision that left spectators bewildered.

The excitement reached its peak with the arrival of Faelara Rest, who descended upon the arena from above. She announced a momentous opportunity: the Trial of Fire, a competition that would allow initiates to breakthrough to the adept level. The trial would select the hundred most talented initiates across their generation, requiring them to form groups of three.

Faelara had already taken special notice of Laura during their heroic return, offering her a prestigious position as her second disciple after her son Quill—a rare honor within the tribe. This new relationship led to Faelara exercising her authority by ordering Laura to join Quill's team for the competition. Despite Laura's preference to compete alongside her companions, she had no choice but to accept, as the arrangement would provide the protection of an adept-level dharma protector. Meanwhile, Thallassios found himself struggling to secure a team, his participation in the trial hanging precariously in the balance.

The party shared their discoveries about the Liberation Sect's activities with the three tribes, though they strategically withheld the revelation about Korrin's origins as an outsider, fearing potential compromises within the tribal leadership. However, their efforts to pursue justice met with unexpected resistance. The leaders of all three tribes uniformly advised the party to distance themselves from the matter, establishing clear boundaries around their involvement in this sensitive political situation.

This response left the group in a complex position, caught between their newfound status as tribal heroes, their individual paths forward in the competition, and the growing web of secrets they now carried.
