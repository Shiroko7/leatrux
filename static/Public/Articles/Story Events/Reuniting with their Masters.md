The next morning, [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]] returned to visit their masters, blissfully unaware of the chaos they had inadvertently caused. As they knocked on the door, they were greeted by the sound of hurried footsteps and the unmistakable jingle of coin hoards – a sound they had become intimately familiar with during their encounter with [[Aurelia, the Golden Temptress]]. [[Elira]] and [[Vanya]] welcomed them enthusiastically, genuinely proud of their disciples' achievements during the trials.

However, when the conversation turned to their potential joining of the [[Liberation Sect]], [[Elira]] pulled [[Nilo]] aside for a private discussion. With her keen senses, she had already detected his cultivation of the fire path – his frequent use of his new technique had left an unmistakable mark on his aura, making him resemble someone more from the [[Tribe Llamarada]] than their own. Despite [[Nilo]]'s attempts at deception, his master's concerned probing finally broke through his defenses. Through tears, he confessed to the bloody path he'd been forced to take for survival. [[Elira]]'s response was one of deep compassion, embracing him and declaring that his achievements and sins were hers to share – he needn't bear his burdens alone. Moved by her sincere support, [[Nilo]] performed the traditional three kowtows in profound respect.

Meanwhile, [[Vanya]]'s conversation with [[Gio]] took a more comedic turn. When she requested the return of her borrowed cores, [[Gio]] sheepishly admitted to having consumed them all during the trial, believing them to be gifts. His master's bewilderment quickly turned to concern as she examined him for signs of qi deviation from such excessive consumption.

When [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] arrived to fetch [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]] for a meeting with [[Durim Stonehammer]], they noticed [[Lime]] at the masters' residence. She appeared to have come for a visit but was leaving without having spoken to anyone. Before [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] could even speak, [[Elira]] and [[Vanya]] hastily shooed their disciples away, insisting they learn to rely on others besides their masters.
