[[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]], having witnessed [[Gio]]'s fiasco, finds himself under [[Elira]]'s extra careful attention. His master repeatedly warns him against any rash actions with the high-grade core. Yet despite his attempts, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] discovers he cannot gather or absorb spiritual energy no matter what method he tries – a familiar flaw he has experienced before due to his [[Dragonmark]]. After several days of failed attempts, [[Elira]] begins brainstorming alternative methods for his breakthrough. She suggests consulting [[Lumina]] from the [[Lluvia Tribe]], who recently succeeded using a method of reading celestial energy from the stars. Unfortunately, [[Elira]] admits she cannot directly help much, having never encountered such a situation – pills don't seem to stimulate him, and finding a compatible artifact as a vessel proves extremely difficult.

On his way to the [[Lluvia Tribe]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] encounters [[Lime]], who walks peacefully with closed eyes, enjoying the morning breeze. With hands clasped behind her back, she carries herself with a carefree dignity. Addressing [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] as her junior brother, she offers cultivation advice as his senior sister. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] ignores this pretense and explains his problem, asking if she knows of any alternative methods. Her suggestion requires consuming someone else's cultivation – a difficult proposition within the tribes. This sparks an idea in [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]], inspired by the _[[Vital Essence Sublimation True Inheritance]]_, to replace the spiritual energy with blood, given his affinity for consuming hearts. [[Lime]] pragmatically notes he would need at least a hundred donors to complete such a ritual.

At the [[Lluvia Tribe]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] finds [[Lumina]] with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]. [[Lumina]] earnestly explains her method, emphasizing it requires study, knowledge, and comprehension rather than talent or spiritual energy. She describes how reading celestial energy allows one to grasp the attraction force of fate, mirrored by the stars to attain a new level. Sometimes, she explains, the heavens themselves might recognize and aid in this process. She praises [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]]'s talent, believing the method would suit him even better than herself, given his genius in medicine and how quickly he would grasp the study of stars. She notes his kindness in saving many people, explaining that this method tests one's fate, with those of demonic nature being rejected by the heavens. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] smiles and nods, though inwardly he feels deeply discouraged, certain he would face severe punishment or rejection due to his dark practices and [[Dragonmark]]. Though [[Lumina]] offers him extensive study materials and an invitation to study during the day, he politely declines, saying he'll seek help from his master. [[Lumina]] respectfully suggests that if [[Elira]] could help, she wouldn't have sent him here in the first place, but doesn't press the issue, offering her help should he ever need it.

Alone with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] casually mentions his need for blood donors for his breakthrough. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] responds with discrete suspicion, asking for details, but agrees to help, suggesting they visit the medical ward for blood samples and potential donations. They decide to check on [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] at the [[Llamarada Tribe]], having heard little news of him. [[Lumina]] had informed [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] that [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] faces a precarious situation, though he seems likely to survive.

As they prepare to leave the tribe, rumors reach their ears. Some seem nonsensical – tales of [[Marisella]] in prolonged seclusion with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]], who is rarely seen. They hear of [[Thornor Bramblehelm]]'s new disciple, supposedly possessing heaven-defying talent – one who completed the great circle of qi refining in just a week and stands poised to breakthrough to the adept stage. The three companions dismiss these rumors, failing to notice anything suspicious about their timing.

Their journey is interrupted by a massive earthquake emanating from the dark mountains. Earth elementals emerge from nowhere, triggering a rock mountain tribulation. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] recognizes it as a foundation establishment tribulation similar to her own. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] decides to investigate, while the others continue toward the [[Lluvia Tribe]].

[[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] wonder at [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s absence from the casino. They discover [[Wang Dabao|Juan David De la Lluvia]] has fallen in the Mahjong rankings, now 20,000 gold in debt. They find only the carefree [[Wang Dabao]], who seems unconcerned about his alter ego's debt, claiming it isn't in his name. When questioned about the ship's marketing mission, he shares the tale of the [[Battleship Immortal]] – a legend of one who conquered the seas with an immortal treasure, a magnificent vessel capable of hosting entire sects. This tale has become popular among the tribe's bards, but its success carries an unforeseen consequence: growing fear and reverence for the sea's power – exactly the kind of belief that could strengthen [[Umberlee]]'s influence.
