[[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] stands atop the dark mountains by the volcano, staring into a seemingly endless crater. His memories of how he arrived here are fuzzy, but the looming danger before him brings clarity to his mind. He recalls his return to his master's dojo – a place that had devolved into chaos, with martial artists being ejected through windows at regular intervals, each one bearing the distinctive marks of thorough defeat.

Inside, he found his older brother [[Gravorn]] writhing on the floor, pleading for help. When [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] approached with concern, [[Gravorn]]'s demeanor shifted instantly – a heinous smile spreading across his face as he seized [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s legs. Declaring to Master [[Kaelan]] that it was his duty to support his junior brother's training, [[Gravorn]] set off a chain reaction. Suddenly, all of [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s elder brothers emerged, eager to "help" their junior escape their own torment. [[Kaelan]], already in a foul mood from the [[Liberation Sect]]'s recent actions, had been pushing the entire dojo to their limits. This "training" translated into daily beatings from his brothers during daylight hours, followed by [[Harpy]]'s special brand of torture when darkness fell.

Now, staring into the volcanic abyss, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] attempts to reason with his elder brothers, who seem disturbingly eager to throw him into the lava – apparently a "breakthrough method" without precedent. Their eyes hold the telltale glaze of [[Harpy]]'s influence, the fey creature herself hovering nearby to witness the proceedings. When [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] asks if she thinks this is truly a good idea, she bluntly responds "No" – before unceremoniously shoving him into the crater herself.

As heat and toxic gases envelope his plummeting form, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] begins his desperate attempt to break his dao seed. The spiritual energy in the volcanic depths proves incredibly dense, requiring only the breaking and absorption phases – a process that might have seemed simple if not for the searing heat and continued free fall. Despite managing admirably under the circumstances, his descent is interrupted by sudden attacks from earth elementals and flying rocks, each threatening to end his breakthrough permanently.

Though he successfully breaks through to the adept level, his immediate survival remains questionable – falling damage being equally lethal whether one lands in lava or not. He frantically attempts every method at his disposal to slow his descent, his pleas to [[Harpy]] met only with indifferent shrugs. Just as he prepares for impact, desperately casting windwalls, he realizes he's already been falling upward, his exit from the crater assured by some unseen force. Left alone on solid ground, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] pants heavily, his brush with death leaving him shaken but successfully advanced in his cultivation.
