The second day of the auction showcased rare treasures and trinkets, with enlightenment tomes drawing particular attention from the gathering's elite. These legendary manuals, capable of permanently enhancing mental and physical attributes, sparked fierce competition among the wealthy clans.

[[Herng]], in a moment of cultivator's delusion, attempted to compete for the [[Tome of Understanding]] against affluent faction leaders, only to watch it fall into [[Bei Li'er]]'s possession for forty-five thousand gold pieces. Similarly, [[Gio]]'s pursuit of the [[Manual of Gainful Exercise]] faltered when [[Llamarada Tribe]] master [[Miko]] pushed the bidding beyond sixty-five thousand gold.

The [[Manual of Quickness Action]] drew attention from multiple factions, including the [[Swiftblade Clan]] and [[Shadowflame Clan]]. [[Thalassios]], presuming unlimited access to [[Nilo]]'s funds, boldly offered thirty thousand gold pieces. Finding himself outbid, he desperately sought [[Wang Dabao|Juan David]]'s assistance, who secured victory with a peculiarly specific bid of forty-three thousand, three hundred thirty-three gold pieces. [[Nilo]]'s fury at this unauthorized debt was only slightly tempered by forcing the bizarre [[Netherbreath Fungus]] upon [[Thalassios]] as compensation.

Other coveted tomes found their masters: the [[Manual of Bodily Health]] went to [[Yu Wei]] of the [[Liberation Sect]], the [[Tome of Clear Thought]] to [[Lady Elowen]], and the [[Tome of Leadership and Influence]] to [[Xie Sulian]], a minor clan elder from the [[Tribe Espora]]. Seated beside them, [[Xie Sulian]]'s purchase prompted [[Herng]]'s tactless inquiry about why an elder in late foundation establishment would desire such an item. She explained the value of such treasures for clan posterity, only to face [[Herng]]'s awkward inquiry about clan membership requirements. When she mentioned birth or marriage as the traditional paths, [[Herng]] misinterpreted her words as a potential proposal. The widowed elder responded with amused flattery rather than offense.

Two amulets drew the party's attention toward the auction's conclusion. The [[Amulet of Curse Warding]] initially interested [[Bei Li'er]], though her lukewarm bidding allowed the party to secure it. More controversially, the [[Amulet of Dual Essence]]—capable of completely transforming one's yin and yang essence to change biological sex—became the target of [[Herng]]'s bidding, further fueling whispered rumors about his peculiar inclinations. When [[Xie Sulian]] commented on his surprising tastes, [[Herng]] claimed it was intended for [[Nilo]], causing [[Lime]] to raise an eyebrow at this unexpected revelation about her companion's interests. [[Nilo]] hastily clarified that he merely sought better understanding of yin energy cultivation. Ultimately, [[Herng]] abandoned the pursuit, and [[Lluvia Tribe]] master [[Ces]] claimed the amulet.
