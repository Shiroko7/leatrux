## Team Magma's Camp

While traveling they had moments of rest where they shared significant fond moments, like when Herng attempted to talk with women and spilled all his spagethi with Marisella for being such a beta male with no drive. Herng also tried to train with Rachel but was completely outclassed and scolded for being so weak besides being in her same Order. Harpy started avoiding herng, and seek out Gio sighing as she said that Herng was a mistake and that the magical tart was wasted on him. She then tells Gio they should bake him into a cake and start again... Gio also had a weird epiphany where he learned a mystical bite ability out of his delusions. Nilo in the other hand got to know Lime a little bit more as she struggles with the strong Yin energy of this site, making it difficult for her to control her wildshape and struggling to make potions. After the incident with the Shadowflame clan members Nilo went to check her up trying to confort her as they are kindred spirits, she smiles telling him to not to worry much, but she can't reveal her secrets yet.
