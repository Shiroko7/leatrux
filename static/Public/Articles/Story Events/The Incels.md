## The Incels

Desperate for gold and resources to repair their ship, the party takes on various missions across the tribes. One mission involves rescuing dozens of missing members reported near the Aquagloom Abyss. Marisella and Rudy, busy with other tasks, stay behind as the rest of the group prepares for the underwater dive.

At the dungeon’s entrance, the party spots a rare Crystalfin worth hundreds of gold and decides to hunt it. The creature leads them to a bottle guarded in its nest, containing a plea for help. The message reveals that the victims are hiding in a secret cave outside the Abyss. They follow the lead, finding a massive, ancient entrance concealed by underwater vegetation. Inside, they discover a draconic inscription on the stone mechanism, which they brute-force open.

The cave system beyond is vast and intricate, its first chamber occupied by giant frogs. Attempting communication, the frogs reveal they ate "weird food" recently and lament their hunger. Leaving the frogs behind, the party ventures deeper, hearing muttering footsteps. They encounter Elandor, a nervous lackey, speaking of Korrin supervising "experiments on the female suspects." Quick-thinking Laura disguises herself as a man with mud, convincing Elandor they’ve been sent by Korrin on behalf of the _Liberation Sect_.

As Elandor naively guides them further, a creature erupts from a hot crater, filling the room with scalding fog. The fire serpent’s core and fire gland become the party’s prize after an intense battle. Amid the chaos, a harpy emerges, having narrowly escaped being eaten by the frogs. Her sudden appearance terrifies Elandor, who mistakes her for a spy from the Lluvia tribe and tries to flee. The party captures him, noting a dark magical tart in his possession.

They press on and discover a horrifying scene: a higher chamber where female cultivators from the Lluvia tribe are held captive, malnourished, and tortured. Herng transforms into a centipede to scout, uncovering that the captors are male deserters from the tribe. These men plan to cement their rebellion with a breakthrough—one of them, Tiberon Grassetto, is on the verge of reaching the Adept Foundation level.

The captors, calling themselves the _Liberation Sect_, are a bitter group cultivating essences stolen from other tribes. Each harbors deep resentment for the Lluvia tribe's matriarchal structure:

- **Grimmy**, a metal cultivator, is a goofy but skilled fighter who denounces the hypocrisy of their oppression.
- **Sylas**, a druid, was exploited by the tribe as a male “vessel” to sire stronger offspring.
- **Auron**, a pretty boy and fire cultivator, scarred himself to escape his former identity. He remains mute, determined to “change his fate.”
- **Dexter**, a wizard of acid, broke under family pressure and fled from his overachieving sister’s shadow.
- **Tiberon**, a former fisher guild higher-up, is the ambitious group leader of their rebellion.

The party strikes first, overwhelming the sect members with their superior coordination and raw power. The sect struggles to match their ferocity, and for a moment, it seems victory is within reach. However, Grimmy, fueled by desperation and the camaraderie he shares with his brothers, lands a lucky and devastating blow on Herng, disrupting his concentration.

With the party momentarily shaken, Tiberon completes his breakthrough and unleashes an Adept-level technique slapping Nilo to unconciousness. Thallassios, blinded by overconfidence and unwilling to retreat, challenges Tiberon head-on. His refusal to back down leads to disaster, as Tiberon counters with overwhelming force, knocking Thallassios and several others unconscious.

Laura, the only party member still conscious, drags Gio and Thallassios to safety through the sandstorm caused by Tiberon’s technique. Seemingly forced to make a split-second decision, she leaves Herng behind, believing him lost. As Laura struggles to move the injured, Nilo miraculously awakens from unconsciousness and casts _Fog Cloud_, providing cover to their retreat.

Despite their injuries, Laura and Nilo pursue the escaping sect at a distance. The _Liberation Sect_, driven by their unbreakable camaraderie, refuses to abandon one another. Dexter, realizing his brothers cannot escape in time, sacrifices himself, using his acid magic to create a barrier and push his unconscious comrades to safety. The scene is one of heartbreak and defiance as the sect narrowly escapes, with Dexter staying behind to face capture.

Back at Herng’s body, Harpy mourns his apparent death. Believing him “too hungry to wake up,” she offers him the magical tart. In truth, the tart is a pact, granting Herng a second chance at life in exchange for becoming the harpy’s champion. Herng accepts, consuming the tart. His charisma surges to extraordinary levels, but at the cost of losing some of his hit dice permanently.

The party, unaware of the tart’s true nature, assumes it simply revived Herng. For now, they regroup, nursing their wounds and reflecting on the sect’s unusual strength and unshakable loyalty.
