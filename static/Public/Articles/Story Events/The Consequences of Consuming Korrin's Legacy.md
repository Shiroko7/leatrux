In the aftermath of their ordeal, each member of the party faced the consequences of their choices during that fateful encounter. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]], driven by her determination to grow stronger, consumed [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s blood on [[Ardathian]]'s suggestion. Her draconic companion, stirring to consciousness at her hasty action, warned her of the path she had chosen. The refinement of her bloodline would mark her as both hunter and hunted among those who sought such power, drawing her into an ancient game of survival. When morning came, she found her body transformed – lighter, more refined, yet somehow marked by this irreversible choice.

Meanwhile, [[Nilo]]'s secret consumption of [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s heart plagued his dreams with a cascade of memories – not only from [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]] himself but from every life he had taken in his recent struggle for survival. In the depths of these nightmare visions, he experienced [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s memories firsthand, feeling an unprecedented heat that seemed to define the very essence of being. He witnessed the harsh reality of orphans toiling in mines, until his attention was drawn to a particular child with purple hair and red eyes. Before he could investigate further, the real [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]] appeared, impressed by [[Nilo]]'s daring.

[[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]] revealed the truth about [[Amaterra]] – a dragon who, pursued across the universe, had fused with the [[Tables of Fate]] to become the very world they inhabited. But the story didn't end there. Two origin dragons, [[Retharax]] and [[Vyrelaxan]], had collaborated to extract fragments of these cosmic tables, using them to forge a heaven-defying furnace. This artifact, [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]] explained, could only be mastered by one who understood both fire and poison law. His centuries-long scheme had been to spread his influence, guiding others to cultivate both paths, hoping one would retrieve this powerful item on his behalf. His legacy, he promised, would spread like wildfire across the island, ensuring none would forget the name [[Korrin Flameheart]]. [[Nilo]], seeing potential salvation from his cursed [[Dragonmark|dragonmark]], agreed to this posthumous pact.

[[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s night proved no less tumultuous. In his dreams, he faced an enraged [[Harpy]] demanding recompense for his betrayal. Through a combination of backbone and flattery – particularly in comparing her favorably to [[Marisella]] – he managed to reduce his punishment from complete annihilation to merely experiencing the force of half a million suns and storms throughout his restless sleep.
