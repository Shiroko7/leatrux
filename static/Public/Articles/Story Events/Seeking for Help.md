The crew began implementing their plan by dividing their efforts. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Gio]] ventured to the [[Tribe Lluvia]] in search of [[Wang Dabao]]. Upon finding [[Wang Dabao|Juan David De la Lluvia]], they proposed their marketing scheme of selling positions aboard the [[Fulh'ulbrech]] as prestigious reservations. [[Wang Dabao]]'s inquiries about [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s debt and potential profits met with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]'s guarded responses, though he eventually agreed despite his reservations. As they departed, [[Sister Mei]], second master of the [[Liberation Sect]], intercepted them with calculated cordiality. Recognizing their shared medical paths with [[Gio]] and [[Nilo]], she offered financial aid through positions in her medical guard, though her surprise at the total debt led her to probe for more valuable assets—specifically, any medical knowledge inherited from [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]] or their homelands.

[[Nilo]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] transported an unconscious [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] to [[Vanya]] and [[Elira]] in the [[Tribe Espora]]. The masters' initial concern over their battle-worn appearance and reduced numbers quickly gave way to scientific curiosity. They served tea and specially prepared cakes, deliberately drugging [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] to further their research on exotic races and their ongoing quest to counter [[Zarvon Fungart|Zarvon]]'s mind-controlling spores. Their examination of [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] revealed disturbing findings—dozens of curses had diminished his physical and mental capabilities, with evidence of extensive memory tampering. [[Nilo]] left [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] to his hallucinogenic journey while the masters explained the days-long process required to remove the curses.

[[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s attempt to settle his [[Trial of Fire]] debts led him to the [[Shadowflame Clan]]'s outpost, where he encountered [[Draven Shadowflame]]. The interaction turned unsettling when [[Draven Shadowflame|Draven]] had to search records for his own matriarch's identity, [[Talia Shadowflame]], his monotonous behavior leaving [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] deeply disturbed. After hastily paying his fee, he avoided his dojo, anticipating a hostile reception, and instead attempted to summon [[Harpy]] through prayer. Her dismissive response directed him to a mountain peak, though his blind faith in following his [[Starmap]] led nowhere. The exercise revealed an observer—[[Yu Zheng]], who introduced himself as [[Yu Wei]]'s brother and first master of the [[Liberation Sect]]. His attempts at intimidation, bolstered by his adept-level cultivation, included boasts of his [[Yu Family]]'s dojo's superiority over [[Kaelan]]'s, forcing [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] to seek refuge in the wilderness.

[[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]], [[Gio]], and [[Nilo]] reconvened to share their progress, their concern for [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s absence leading them to the [[Tribe Llamarada]]. While [[Nilo]] maintained his distance, [[Gio]] seized the opportunity to challenge [[Thornor Bramblehelm]], the tribe's supreme patriarch. They found him contemplating the [[Record of the Isle's Honored One]], with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Gio|Gio]]'s disappointment at his exclusion from the record—reserved only for true inheritance recipients like [[Lime]]—fueling his determination for the match.

The arena filled with spectators as [[Thornor Bramblehelm|Thornor]], already stressed by recent events with the [[Liberation Sect]] and [[Mu Youqing]] agreed eager to give [[Gio]] a good beating, demonstrated power approaching the realm beyond nascent soul. His initial flurry of strikes sent [[Public/Articles/PCs/Gio|Gio]] flying repeatedly, while questioning his choice of the poison path. When [[Public/Articles/PCs/Gio|Gio]] finally landed a hit, [[Thornor Bramblehelm|Thornor]] unleashed his [[Metal]] abilities, demanding [[Public/Articles/PCs/Gio|Gio]] use his poison powers rather than rely solely on martial arts. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Gio|Gio]]'s explanation of using poison to enhance his abilities failed to impress, though his desperate transformation into a [[Xuanwu Turtle]] and attempt to bite [[Thornor Bramblehelm|Thornor]]'s bald head showed spirit, if not wisdom. The patriarch responded with a divine ability that nearly stopped [[Public/Articles/PCs/Gio|Gio]]'s heart, ending the match. As [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Gio|Gio]] attempted to lighten the mood, [[Thornor Bramblehelm|Thornor]]'s growing headache led him to forcefully expel them from tribal grounds, sending them flying thousands of miles away.
