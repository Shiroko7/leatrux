Seeking solitude to commune with [[Selune]] through the [[Frostreaver]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] initially struggled to make contact. Only after descending to the colder depths of underwater ruins did [[Selune]]'s illusory form finally manifest beside him. There, she began an intimate instruction on the fundamentals of cultivation, particularly focused on the critical moment of breakthrough.

[[Selune]] explained that cultivation begins with the formation of a dao seed through the absorption and refinement of spiritual energy. The breakthrough process involves carefully opening this seed, allowing it to sprout roots that would form the foundation of one's entire cultivation journey. This delicate phase, she warned, was when a cultivator was most vulnerable.

She outlined the various paths to breakthrough, each with its own advantages and perils. The orthodox method, favored by the three great tribes, involved a gradual breaking of the seed using an elemental core to direct spiritual energy. While safe, its success heavily depended on having access to spiritually rich spaces and protective formations—resources typically reserved for those with powerful backing.

Alternative methods each carried their own complications: foundation pills, though expensive, offered mediocre results at best; magical artifacts could serve as vessels but required perfect compatibility with their user; heart tribulation, a method natural to beasts, proved dangerously taxing for humans; and the unorthodox paths often involved the darker practice of consuming others' foundations.

[[Selune]] patiently answered [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]]'s questions—questions he had never been able to ask without a formal master. Her counsel was clear: the orthodox method, though safest, would not suit him given his lack of proper training. Armed with this knowledge, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] resolved to acquire multiple water elemental cores and retreat into seclusion for his attempt.

Deep in an isolated underwater cave encrusted with ice, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] began his unconventional breakthrough attempt. Following [[Selune]]'s guidance, he chose to use the [[Frostreaver]] as his cultivation vessel, a dangerous but potentially powerful method. The process began with an act that required tremendous courage – stabbing his own dantian to initiate the artifact's assimilation.

Though the initial stages proceeded with only minor complications, each step of the process proved increasingly taxing. Time stretched endlessly in the cold depths as [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] found himself trapped in a bottleneck during the final phase of nurturing the weapon. Days blurred together as exhaustion and damage accumulated in his body. With each failed attempt, the [[Frostreaver]] threatened to reverse the process and assimilate him instead, held at bay only by [[Selune]]'s protective consciousness. In these desperate moments, she was forced to merge a fragment of herself with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] to prevent his destruction.

As he lay near death, [[Selune]] made her final sacrifice. She offered up her clone's essence to heal his wounds and restore his depleted energy, bidding him a bittersweet farewell with hopes of a future reunion. Yet even with this gift, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] continued to struggle. Through the fragments of [[Selune]]'s memories now residing within him, he glimpsed a potential solution – the water clone technique she had once mastered.

In his second attempt, he finally achieved what had seemed impossible. The merger with the [[Frostreaver]] was complete, but the victory came at a price. Alone in his icy sanctuary, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] fell into an exhausted slumber, his sense of identity blurred by two weeks of sleepless cultivation and the echoes of [[Selune]]'s memories within his mind.
