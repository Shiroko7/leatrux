## The Treant Battle

Following traces of blood and sounds of combat, the party discovered their companions—[[Marisella]], [[Rachel Darm]], [[Laura Bush]], [[Quill Rest]], [[Lumina]], [[Wang Dabao]], and [[Lime]]—locked in an intense battle with a massive treant. The chamber presented a gruesome scene - the floor was strewn with countless corpses, victims of a massacre that had claimed lives from both the three great tribes and the liberation sect. It became clear that [[Sylas]], in his transformed state, had slaughtered many of his own sect members as well as members of the great tribes before the party's arrival. At the room's center, a spiritual pool pulsed with magical energy, feeding the treant's strength and sustaining the horror of the ongoing carnage.

Within the treant's form, they recognized Elder Brother [[Sylas]] of the liberation sect, partially transformed by one of [[Mu Youqing]]'s puppets. Despite Sylas's resistance to the transformation, the treant continued to heal itself by drawing power from the spiritual pool. The party's arrival turned the tide of battle, though they had to exercise caution to avoid harming [[Sylas]], whom they needed to control the inheritance. Though they succeeded in defeating the treant, [[Sylas]] was gravely wounded, requiring the use of their last Tear of Crystalina to save his life.

In the battle's aftermath, [[Wang Dabao]] approached [[Nilo]] with concerns about his association with [[Lime]], offering to introduce him to [[Velira]]'s supposedly less dangerous friends. [[Nilo]]'s response—a blood-stained smile carrying a hint of murderous intent—quickly ended the conversation, with [[Wang Dabao|Wang]] hastily apologizing to [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and returning her flying broom.

[[Laura Bush]] broke the ensuing silence with crucial revelations about the inheritance. She explained that the current trials represented only half of the true inheritance, with the island's blessing being the other crucial component. She recounted how 500 years ago, [[Mu Youqing]]'s attempt to share the inheritance by having everyone drink from it had ended in tragedy when [[Faelara]] took control, causing all who had partaken to wither away.
