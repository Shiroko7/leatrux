## The Femcels

Seeking additional resources, the party undertook a mining expedition to the volcano. After hours of exhausting work yielding only meager rewards, they decided to venture deeper into the volcano despite clear warning signs, hoping to find rarer materials.

Deep within the volcanic caves, they stumbled upon a group of women performing a mysterious ritual—a combination of poison and fire methods designed to transform someone into a fire elemental. Most of the participants wore common robes, except for one figure in elegant black attire. Before the situation could be properly assessed, Thallassios impulsively attacked the group, transforming what could have been a rescue mission into a violent confrontation. Though the women were later confirmed to be Liberation Sect members, the initial attack led to tragic consequences.

The ensuing battle proved brutal. Pipkin, a kindly but heavyset follower, met a gruesome end when Thallassios forced her into the lava. Nilo struck down Lina, a young girl who showed no signs of being a cultivator. Two other members—Isolde, a wood cultivator, and Velira, a poison cultivator and the noblewoman in black robes—fought back fiercely. Their leader, Cinder, having partially completed the ritual, engaged the party as a half-formed fire elemental. Though Cinder was eventually defeated and surrendered alongside Isolde, Velira destroyed potential evidence before fleeing deeper into the volcano.

Laura and Marisella, horrified by the unnecessary violence, confronted Thallassios about his rash behavior. As the party debated whether to use their captives to reach Korrin or turn them over to tribal justice—knowing either choice likely meant death or servitude for the women—they were interrupted by the arrival of Nerion Shadowflame, a young noble master searching for his sister, Velira.

The confrontation with Nerion proved tense, especially with his hidden adept-level escorts nearby. The party ultimately surrendered custody of their captives to Nerion's group, who continued deeper into the volcano in pursuit of Velira. After their departure, Marisella revealed crucial information about the Shadowflame clan: Velira had been stripped of her position as heir due to her inability to cultivate the clan's methods, replaced by her younger brother Nerion after the death of another heir in battle. Marisella also noted the captured women's unusual devotion to Korrin, suggesting they might be concealing deeper involvement with the Liberation Sect despite their apparent innocence.
