At the mountains, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] encounters his elder brother [[Valkor]], who immediately grabs him, using the dwarf as both shield and weapon against the elementals while collecting their cores, insisting that proximity increases their chances of profit. Despite the chaos, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] notices careful preparation – masters and supreme elders gathered to witness the event. When he finally sees this genius disciple, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] stands perplexed as [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] recites his poem:

_"The stone waits, unmoving and eternal; the hammer sings, forging destiny. Strike by strike, I cast off the false— when the dust settles, only [[Durim Stonehammer]] remains."_

[[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] descended from the heights like some divine messenger, his unexpected grace contrasting sharply with his typically earthbound demeanor. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] stood frozen in perplexity, words failing him as the transformed dwarf offered a solemn salute. Gone was the hunched, anxious shipwright perpetually fussing over timber and nails—in his place stood a figure radiating newfound purpose.

The exchange that followed revealed [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s peculiar transformation. He spoke of leaving behind his "beta" nature, embracing what he called his "winter arc" and "sigma grinding." His regrets regarding [[Bei Li'er]] and the mounting debts had catalyzed this strange metamorphosis. Unable to work on the ship due to prohibition, he had redirected his crafting instincts inward—building not a vessel of wood and iron, but reshaping himself into a metaphorical battleship capable of transporting everyone from the island.

When questioned about the duration of this transformation, [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] revealed that witnessing [[Thornor Bramblehelm]]'s decisive victory over [[Gio]] had inspired him to seek the patriarch as a master. The subsequent rejection had been physical and immediate—a powerful kick launching him into these very mountains, where he had taken the hint quite literally. His regimen consisted of two daily hours of intense training, maintained faithfully for a week.

[[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s inquiries about other encounters elicited an awkward, evasive response regarding [[Harpy]]. [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] described the encounter with unnatural detachment, as if encountering a stranger rather than a creature the crew had known since their arrival. His faltering explanation revealed only that [[Harpy]] had told him, in no uncertain terms, to kill himself—a directive delivered with the casual cruelty that had become her hallmark. The dwarven shipwright's reluctance to elaborate further on this exchange hung in the air, heavy with unspoken significance.

Completely misinterpreting [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s reluctance to discuss [[Harpy]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] made suggestions that carried unintended intimacy—proposing they find a more private, comfortable setting to continue their conversation. His tone and phrasing created an atmosphere thick with unintended suggestion, causing visible discomfort in [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]].

[[Valkor]]'s intervention came as a merciful interruption to this escalating awkwardness. The tribesman admonished [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] for his seemingly inappropriate advances, citing tribal cultural standards. Yet even this explicit rebuke failed to penetrate [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s obliviousness to the situation.

The scene concluded with swift finality as [[Valkor]], patience exhausted, launched the still-confused dwarf down the mountainside. As [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s form receded into the distance, [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] and [[Valkor]] exchanged a glance of mutual understanding, the uncomfortable moment disappearing as quickly as its unwitting instigator.
