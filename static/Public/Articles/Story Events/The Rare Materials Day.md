On the day of the auction, with all members of [[The Three Great Tribes]] and the newly incorporated [[Liberation Sect]] in attendance, our party arrived late, gazing upon the eager multitude gathered for the spectacle. Influential figures from all factions had assembled to bid on rare treasures, with the charming [[Dhalia]] from the [[Lluvia Tribe]] serving as auctioneer. The crew chose seats beside [[Lime]], positioned between the [[Lluvia Tribe]] and [[Tribe Espora]] sections. [[Herng]] joined them, completely oblivious to his conspicuous displacement among the cultivation elites.

The first day focused on rare materials, and immediately an item captured everyone's attention. The [[Heart Of Shadow]] – a sinister, ominous heart from a corrupted ancient beast, pulsing with dark energy. Its gruesome appearance made cultivators recoil, yet [[Nilo]] regarded it with the appreciation of a connoisseur eyeing a delicacy. [[Gio]], concerned about his companion's self-control, received a whispered confession – [[Nilo]] desired it for his breakthrough but would need restraint lest he consume it impulsively.

When [[Su Yaolan]] made the opening bid, [[Nilo]] swiftly countered, provoking hatred from [[Liberation Sect]] males who had elevated her to goddess status. From their perspective, this foreigner who had already accepted her gift now dared to deprive her of this treasure! [[Nilo]] approached [[Su Yaolan]] directly, explaining his need for a special cultivation technique and inquiring about her purpose for the item. She revealed her intent to practice her dao of cleansing through purification of the heart. Their negotiation led to an agreement to split both cost and usage – an arrangement that bewildered onlookers and sparked fresh rumors about their relationship. The [[Heart Of Shadow]] ultimately went to [[Nilo]] for two thousand gold pieces.

Next came the [[Netherbreath Fungus]], a curious organism from the [[Aquagloom Abyss]] capable of independent respiration. While some [[Tribe Espora]] members showed interest, including [[Goon]] with his persistent lowballing and master [[Camellia Bush]], competition remained modest. [[Nilo]], harboring schemes involving [[Thalassios]]'s face, secured it for a mere thousand gold.

The auction continued with the [[Serpent's Molt Of The Abyss]], which immediately drew [[Gio]]'s attention as he fulfilled his masters' shopping list. Predictably, [[Kazren Serpentsoul]] began inflating the price to discourage competitors. [[Gio]] attempted to negotiate, offering his exotic genes as bargaining leverage, but [[Kazren]] deemed the item essential for his clan's primal beast mating rituals. As their bidding war escalated, a third contender emerged – [[Wang Dabao|Juan David De la Lluvia]], accompanied by a small blue [[The Serpent|Serpiente]], entered the fray with surprising determination. When [[Gio]] threatened to expose [[Wang Dabao|Juan]]'s secrets, the latter reluctantly withdrew, much to [[The Serpent|Serpiente]]'s dismay. [[Kazren]], however, ruthlessly drove the price beyond one hundred thousand gold, forcing [[Gio]] to abandon his pursuit.

The [[Everheart Root]] – a material from an exceedingly rare sacred tree that continued to pulse like a living heart – became the next battlefield. [[Gio]] adopted an aggressive bidding strategy, dismissing notable competitors like [[Mu Taozhen]] from the [[Tribe Espora]]. [[Kazren]], seeking retribution for the earlier confrontation, nearly doubled the price purely out of spite. Undeterred, [[Gio]] increased his bid to fifty thousand gold coins – several times the initial asking price. This extravagance shocked even his closest companions, fueling speculation about the mysterious source of [[Gio]] and [[Nilo]]'s wealth, with many assuming their masters' exploits funded such lavish expenditure.
