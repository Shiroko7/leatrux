After her outburst, [[Harpy]] focused on unlocking the mask, revealing it to be a gateway to another chamber. As the party entered, they found themselves engulfed in an ethereal atmosphere - a green fog with dark undertones permeating the space. At its center stood a podium emanating an otherworldly essence, which each member perceived uniquely. Despite its beckoning presence, only [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] and [[Nilo]] approached, while the others held back with visible hesitation. A feminine yet abstract entity, manifesting as the will of the island, sighed at their apparent lack of unity.

The green mist thickened around them, and they suddenly realized only the core five remained. The entity introduced herself, inquiring about their purpose. She expressed her belief that their connection to her close associates must have meant they were potential allies. However, the party's confusion quickly dispelled this notion. She revealed that [[Gio]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]], and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] had been brought by her followers, while [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Nilo]]'s presence, though seemingly unconnected, intrigued her due to their [[Dragonmark|dragonmarks]].

The entity contemplated whether they might be chosen by the ghosts, disciples of her followers, dragon disciples, or bound by some unknown fate, but found herself perplexed by the absence of such connections. She identified herself as the leader of the [[The Shadow Sect|Shadow Sect]], explaining that trial winners become external disciples, while those with her continued approval could ascend to inner disciples. [[Harpy]], she noted, served as a self-proclaimed saintess, scouting talent across the island.

When questioned about the sect's mission, she unveiled an ambitious plan to open pathways to the Feywild and Shadowfell, aiming to establish the cycle of rebirth in [[Amaterra]]. She expressed regret at the misunderstanding, explaining she wouldn't have permitted their presence had she known they weren't aligned with her cause, as she valued loyalty above all else.

Finally, she revealed herself as [[Phudara]], recounting her ancient conflict with [[Retharax]] the origin red dragon and [[Vyrelaxan]] the origin green dragon. She spoke of killing one and sealing the other in the volcano, while nurturing the island's inhabitants and preparing for [[Retharax]]'s inevitable return. She exposed [[Korrin Flameheart]] as a spy from house Veridis, connected to both dragons.

Encouraging the party to focus on immediate concerns rather than larger schemes, she asked them to name worthy winners for the trial of fire. [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]] supported [[Lime]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] backed [[Lumina]], while [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] chose [[Rachel Darm]]. Recognizing her growing needs, [[Phudara]] decided to cast a wider net this cycle, recruiting multiple promising candidates: [[Lumina]], [[Lime]], [[Quill Rest]], and [[Sylas]]. Though clearly doubtful of their potential, she hoped that at least one of them might prove useful to her cause. She ultimately granted the wood inheritance to [[Lime]] for her wooden cultivation abilities.
