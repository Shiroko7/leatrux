The party reached a fork in their path. Consulting his magical map, [[Herng Azurit|Herng]] received guidance to proceed straight ahead. Burdened by their substantial treasure of gold-filled chests, the group decided to conceal their loot in a corner, protecting it with a simple alarm spell before moving forward.

While his companions advanced, [[Gio]] lingered behind to investigate the alternate path. There, he discovered a chamber containing an imposing feminine mask with dim crimson crystal eyes. Though unsettled, he chose not to investigate further and rejoined the group, sharing his discovery with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]].
 
Ahead, the party encountered what appeared to be humanoid figures restrained on the floor. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] recognized this as an illusion trap, but before he could fully warn his companions, a Giant Scorpion struck with devastating speed, incapacitating him in a single blow. The group rallied quickly, defeating the creature and using [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]'s divine rain ability to restore their health during a brief ten-minute rest.
