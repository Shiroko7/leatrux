# The Fateful eclipse

The scene opens with **[[Nilo]]**, bruised and groggy, awakening from the unconsciousness brought on by [[Umberlee|Emberlee]]'s punishment. As his vision clears, he realizes he’s not alone in the ship's hold. A young girl, with striking white hair and wearing the simple servant robes of the crew, stands nearby. Her expression is distant, emotionless. She introduces herself as **[[Ilmatera|Illira]]** and, much like [[Nilo]], her body bears the marks of past suffering. She quietly asks if [[Nilo]] is in pain, her words carrying an unspoken understanding. Their brief conversation offers [[Nilo]] a strange sense of comfort, a brief respite from his own torment. [[Ilmatera|Illira]] then tells him to come to the deck to witness the lunar eclipse that will take place tonight.

When [[Nilo]] arrives on deck, the rest of the crew is already there, gathered around in hushed anticipation. **[[Satlypaws]]**, the ship's navigator, motions for everyone to extinguish the lights, so the full majesty of the moment can be felt. As the eclipse begins, the world is enveloped in a deep, unsettling darkness. The crew feels an unknown force pressing against them, followed by the eerie sensation of being watched. Unseen voices mutter in the shadows, accompanied by the chilling sound of something stabbing into the air.

Suddenly, the darkness is broken as one of the crew members lights a torch, and in the dim glow, the body of **[[Thistle]]**, the ship’s navigator, is discovered. He has been brutally murdered before he could witness the breakthrough he worked so hard for. The crew, caught standing near the body, is swiftly blamed, and they are thrown into the ship's brig as the primary suspects in the murder.

In the cramped and tense confines of the jail, the main characters come together for the first time. They exchange introductions—**[[Gio]]**, **[[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]**, **[[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]**, **[[Nilo]]**, and **[[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thallassios]]**. It’s clear that no one trusts one another, and suspicion runs high. **[[Umberlee|Emberlee]]**, the quartermaster, demands that a culprit be found and executed, pushing the group to make a terrible choice: take the blame as a group, or sacrifice one among them.

**[[Marisella]]**, the ship's healer, visits them in the brig, bringing food and water and offering comfort, but her words are as uncertain as the situation. **[[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thallassios]]**, a quiet and solemn figure, decides to sacrifice himself, feeling an inevitability to his fate. However, **[[Vexa]]**, who has been put in charge of the prosecution, reveals that **[[Umberlee|Emberlee]]** has taken a liking to [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thallassios]] because of his fishing skills, so he would be spared. The group is left to choose someone else, a decision that weighs heavily on them all.
