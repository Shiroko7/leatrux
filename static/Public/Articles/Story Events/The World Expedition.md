# The World Expedition

The story begins with an ambitious journey originating in [[Imia]]—a grand expedition to traverse all the lands of [[Amaterra]]. Central to this mission is the **[[Fulh'ulbrech]]**, a colossal sailing ship capable of housing a crew of 100–200 people. This monumental endeavor is funded by the wealthy magnate **[[ Eldon Deunwise ]]**, whose peculiar ambition is to make his beloved dog, **[[Saltypaws]]**, the first to "conquer the oceans." To achieve this, [[Eldon Deunwise|Eldon]] recruited people from across **[[Imia]]**, **[[Yomel]]**, and **[[Okateira]]**, assembling a diverse and capable crew.

# The Main Characters

(As they joined the expedition)

**[[Laura Cassini]]**

- **Age**: 21
- **Race/Class**: Human Ranger
- **Background**: Hailing from Imia, Laura bears the **Mark of Finding**, a dragonmark that aligns with her talent for exploration. She joined the expedition to search for her missing father, hoping to deliver the tragic news of her mother’s passing.

**[[Nilo]]**

- **Age**: 17
- **Race/Class**: Half-Elf Rogue

His father vanished during the war, and his mother passed away when he was a child.

His hope is that traveling far from Imia will eventually lead to liberation.

**[[Gio]]**

- **Age**: 25
