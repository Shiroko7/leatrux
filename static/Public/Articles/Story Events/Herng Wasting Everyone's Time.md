The day after starting their ship fundraising plans, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] met with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Gio|Gio]] at the [[Tribe Lluvia]]. They couldn't believe he was still fixated on finding [[Harpy]], especially after she'd sent him on a pointless mountain chase. Despite their doubts, they agreed to follow him to [[Faelara Rest]]'s order's peaks, where he insisted [[Harpy]] would be.

At the [[Tribe Espora]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] woke up sore and angry about being experimented on. He went to confront [[Nilo]] but found him trapped in what seemed like a nightmare. When [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] tried to wake him, [[Nilo]] unconsciously used his heart-consuming technique. Thanks to [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]]'s fire resistance and strong constitution, the attack didn't worry him. When confronted, [[Nilo]] tried claiming it was just an unusual reaction to the tribe's food. This excuse fell apart when [[Vanya]] used the same explanation, leading [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] to demand they respect his rights and ask permission before future experiments. The masters shrugged, offered a casual apology and some candy, and sent them off to find [[Gio]] before beginning their seclusion.

The reunited party climbed the peaks with [[Aeris]], one of [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]'s senior sisters. They passed [[Quill Rest]] on their way up, clearly depressed. [[Aeris]] explained that losing his arm in the [[Trial of Fire]] meant he could no longer follow his mother's [[Arcane Archer]] path. Rather than offer sympathy, the party just mentally listed possible solutions and avoided talking to him.

Meeting with [[Faelara Rest|Faelara]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] launched into an incomprehensible explanation about searching for a magical creature in her residence for training purposes. His convoluted story and suspicious behavior left [[Faelara Rest|Faelara]] visibly baffled, yet [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]], completely misreading the situation, proceeded to make suggestive comments that only made things more awkward. As they prepared to leave, [[Faelara Rest|Faelara]] casually mentioned meeting with the [[Harpy|little will of the island]], [[Quill Rest]], [[Sylas]], and [[Shui Yuan'hua]] the previous day. Only then did the party finally realize this was the same [[Faelara Rest|Faelara]] from the stories of the wood element [[Trial of Fire]] 500 years ago, a connection they had somehow failed to make despite the obvious signs.

When [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] awkwardly pitched their fundraising plan for the [[Fulh'ulbrech]], [[Faelara Rest|Faelara]] was skeptical but said she'd try to help if possible. She explained that while [[Trial of Fire]] winners rarely talked to each other, they could recognize fellow [[The Shadow Sect|Shadow Sect]] members. She encouraged them to build connections across the three tribes with them and shared the [[Record of the Isle's Honored One|Record of the Isle's Honored Ones]]. The only name that caught their attention was [[Wang Tian'bao]], since it reminded them of that [[Wang Dabao|fatty]]. After this, everyone split up to their tribes to begin their seclusion and attempt their breakthroughs.
