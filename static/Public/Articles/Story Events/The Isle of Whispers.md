After surviving the devastating ordeal of [[The Ghosts of the Sea]], the crew finds themselves stranded on the shores of an unknown island. The [[Fulh'ulbrech]], battered and barely afloat, limps onto land. Before disembarking, the survivors assess the state of the crew—only a dozen remain alive out of the hundred that had originally set sail. Among the fallen is [[Griznak]], the ship’s second-in-command, whose lifeless body lies in the lower deck. Venturing to the hold, they find [[Durim Stonehammer]], his eyes bloodshot and his hands trembling, tirelessly working to repair what remains of the ship despite being drenched in blood.

As the group regroups, [[Nilo]] returns from scavenging the wreckage with a strange revelation: a pristine, white-furred [[The Goat|goat]] had been feasting on the dead bodies near the wreck. Unsettled by this discovery, the crew follows him to inspect the animal. Upon closer examination, they find the [[The Goat|goat]] calm and silent, but unnervingly unnatural. Its teeth are sharp, jagged, and unmistakably carnivorous. Despite its grotesque behavior, the goat does not react aggressively to the crew. Instead, it stares intently at [[Nilo]] and begins following him, its presence becoming an unnerving shadow.

As the crew discusses what to do next, they are approached by a small figure that seemingly appears out of nowhere. The creature is unlike anything they have ever seen—small and fey-like, with vibrant green hair and an unsettlingly dark complexion. She introduces herself as [[Harpy]], a name that strikes an odd contrast with her innocent yet eerie appearance. [[Harpy]] explains, with an air of irritated resignation, that since the crash of their ship destroyed her “entire family,” she has no choice but to accept them as her new masters.

The crew is baffled by her words, but what truly unsettles them is [[Harpy]]’s very existence. In the world of [[Amaterra]], fey creatures like her are unheard of. They exist in neither legend nor historical record, and her presence defies any natural understanding of the world.

As the group ventures beyond the crash site, they are greeted by the island’s inhabitants—a group of humanoids who seem both cautious and reverent. The locals mistake the crew for immortals, divine beings descended from the heavens. This misunderstanding is rooted in the crew’s unusual arrival and the awe-inspiring destruction wrought by the crash. Despite the crew’s attempts to correct them, the islanders remain insistent, addressing them with reverence and asking if they are messengers of venerable immortals.

The islanders introduce themselves as members of three great tribes:

The [[Tribe Lluvia]], whose members are closely tied to water and rain,

The [[Tribe Llamarada]], fierce warriors aligned with fire and ash, and

The [[Tribe Espora]], a secretive group deeply connected to nature and growth.


The tribes invite the crew to learn their ways and explore the island. However, the tribes soon ask something more of them: to align themselves with one of the tribes as external representatives. This decision will shape the crew’s influence on the [[Isle of Whispers]] and the dynamics of their survival.

Meanwhile, the strange [[The Goat|goat]] continues to follow [[Nilo]], its silent, predatory presence adding an air of unease. [[Harpy]]’s enigmatic smile and cryptic remarks only deepen the mysteries of the island and its strange inhabitants.
