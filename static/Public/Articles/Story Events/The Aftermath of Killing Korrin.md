In the wake of [[Korrin Flameheart]]'s defeat, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] moved to collect blood samples, driven by [[Ardathian]]'s promise of draconic refinement. [[Gio]] joined the collection, prompted by [[The Serpet|Serpent]]'s whispers of fortune. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]], hearing [[Harpy]]'s warnings about the dragon blood's value, watched as his companions gathered the precious material. Meanwhile, [[Nilo]] quietly performed his own ritual, consuming [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s heart under the pretense of medical examination. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] stood bewildered at his companions' eager collection of [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s blood, accepting their actions despite not grasping its significance.

The unconscious [[Llyrith]] and [[Zara]], along with the deceased [[Malek]] and [[Ravion]], were left behind despite [[Nilo]]'s calls for execution, stayed by [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s intervention. [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s possessions - including Daoist robes, an exotic furnace, a [[House Viridis]] bag of holding, and an interdimensional mansion key - were distributed among the party, with [[Phudara]] claiming the bag of holding for herself.

[[Phudara]] warned against hasty attempts to breach the [[House Viridis]] mansion's protections. When discussion turned to [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s broader schemes, she shrugged off the responsibility with a casual "I'm too young for these plots," though not before presenting the party with an inflated bill - charging double for resurrection materials with an innocent smile.

Through the magical gate, [[Rachel Darm|Rachel]] and [[Quill Rest|Quill]] witnessed [[Mu Youqing]]'s devastating assault on the three great tribes. His army of puppets and clones overwhelmed even the supreme elders, claiming dozens of lives while capturing many others alive. As chaos engulfed the island, he carved an unimpeded path toward the [[Infernoheart Citadel]], marking the party's exit from the [[Trial of Fire]] into a world now thrown into turmoil.
