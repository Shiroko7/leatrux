[[Gio]] and [[Nilo]] returned to their masters' residence, where [[Vanya]] and [[Elira]] led them to a secluded pool pulsing with poisonous spiritual energy. The masters revealed high-grade poison cores for their breakthrough attempt – artifacts that radiated such sinister and deadly energy that merely being in their presence inspired visceral fear and revulsion. Yet to [[Gio]]'s eyes, the core appeared as enticing as the sweetest candy imaginable.

Unable to resist the influence of his cursed lollipop, [[Gio]] impulsively grabbed the core and swallowed it whole, much to everyone's horror. His body immediately convulsed, dropping him to the ground as his scales began shifting through impossible, unnatural colors. [[Vanya]]'s desperate attempts to induce vomiting proved futile, forcing the masters to rush him to their chambers for emergency surgery before the corrosion could spread. [[Nilo]] waited anxiously outside as they worked, catching glimpses of his unconscious friend still cycling through chromatic transformations. [[Vanya]] eventually emerged to explain that [[Gio]] had entered a heart tribulation – a process typically experienced by spirit beasts, not cultivators.

In his unconscious state, [[Gio]] experienced a profound vision spanning the breadth of evolution itself. He witnessed life in its most fundamental forms: a self-replicating molecule, single-celled organisms, primitive ocean creatures, the rise of land-dwelling beings, and the age of great reptiles. Through countless cycles of life and death, predator and prey, he observed the endless march of evolution. The vision culminated in an encounter with an ancient serpentine being who posed a singular question about life's meaning, warning that his answer would determine whether he could wake.

While [[Vanya]] maintained her vigilant meditation over [[Gio]]'s unconscious form, none noticed as a small [[The Serpent|Serpent]] emerged from the cursed lollipop like a shed skin. Though it sensed [[The Goat]]'s influence and yearned for vengeance, it chose instead to explore the surroundings while [[Gio]] remained unconscious, leaving yet another scheme to quietly unfold.

After five days of contemplation, [[Gio]] offered his answer about life's meaning, only to be met with silence. Frustrated, he attempted to force his awakening through self-harm, only to become aware of another presence that had been observing him all along. In the vast darkness of his consciousness, he could perceive only a single massive eye belonging to some ancient reptilian being – an eye so enormous that even trying to comprehend its full scale made his mind reel. This primordial entity urged him to reflect deeper on his visions, leading [[Gio]] to finally grasp that what he had witnessed was not reincarnation, but the memory of evolution itself encoded in his very being. The moment this understanding crystallized with the word "Evolution," his consciousness returned.

[[Vanya]]'s relief at [[Gio]]'s awakening quickly turned to shock as his transformation continued – his old shell could no longer contain him, and a new one began to form in its place. After sharing words about his recklessness, she delivered a well-deserved slap, hoping to instill better judgment in her impulsive disciple's future decisions.
