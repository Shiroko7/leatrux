Meanwhile, the supervising masters are urgently summoned to the [[Llamarada Tribe]]. Sensing something amiss, [[Nilo]] & [[Gio]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] & [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]]'s follow them. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] and [[Marisella]], slower than [[Rachel Darm|Rachel]], stop to help a lost girl, [[Nara]], searching for her father. They arrive at the tribe to find massive fires engulfing the master district. Even the fire cultivators struggle to contain the flames, and the tribes cooperate to manage the disaster.

The party learns that [[Korrin Flameheart]], a [[Tribe Llamarada|Llamarada]] master accused of secretly cultivating forbidden essences, resisted arrest and defeated [[Kaelan]], the earth master, leaving him gravely injured. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] rushes into the burning mansion to save [[Nara]]'s father, though he is severely injured and crippled. [[Nilo]] steps up to treat his injuries, saving his future. After the fire is controlled, [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]] are praised by [[Vanya]] and [[Elira]], who formally take them as disciples and assign them another core, revealing they needed two for the trial. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] and [[Marisella]] are similarly rewarded for their bravery, with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] assigned to [[Kaelan]] and [[Marisella]] to [[Morwen Darm]].

[[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]], with only one core between them, decide [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] should attempt the duel. He challenges [[Llyrith]], a storm sorceress who has repeatedly failed her duels. [[Llyrith]] eagerly accepts, underestimating him. During the duel, their intense battle draws a crowd, including the supreme elders. Though [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] nearly ends it quickly, [[Llyrith]] counters with fog essence, turning the fight into a chaotic, blind exchange. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] ultimately exploits a weakness to land a decisive blow, winning the duel and earning recognition from the matriarch. However, he struggles to find a master, as most of the tribeâ€™s organizations are female-only.

With their trials complete, everyone but [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] becomes an external disciple. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]], still needing another core, resolves to continue. The party, now recognized, can take on missions from the tribes' boards, provided they cooperate under the approval of a master.
