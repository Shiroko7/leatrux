## A Rogue Fire-Poison Cultivator

Meanwhile, the supervising masters are urgently summoned to the Llamarada tribe. Sensing something amiss, Nilo & Gio and Laura & Thallassios follow them. Herng and Marisella, slower than Rachel, stop to help a lost girl, Nara, searching for her father. They arrive at the tribe to find massive fires engulfing the master district. Even the fire cultivators struggle to contain the flames, and the tribes cooperate to manage the disaster.

The party learns that Korrin Flameheart, a Llamarada master accused of secretly cultivating forbidden essences, resisted arrest and defeated Kaelan, the earth master, leaving him gravely injured. Herng rushes into the burning mansion to save Nara's father, though he is severely injured and crippled. Nilo steps up to treat his injuries, saving his future. After the fire is controlled, Nilo and Gio are praised by Vanya and Elira, who formally take them as disciples and assign them another core, revealing they needed two for the trial. Herng and Marisella are similarly rewarded for their bravery, with Herng assigned to Kaelan and Marisella to Morwen.

Laura and Thallassios, with only one core between them, decide Thallassios should attempt the duel. He challenges Llyrith, a storm sorceress who has repeatedly failed her duels. Llyrith eagerly accepts, underestimating him. During the duel, their intense battle draws a crowd, including the supreme elders. Though Thallassios nearly ends it quickly, Llyrith counters with fog essence, turning the fight into a chaotic, blind exchange. Thallassios ultimately exploits a weakness to land a decisive blow, winning the duel and earning recognition from the matriarch. However, he struggles to find a master, as most of the tribeâ€™s organizations are female-only.

With their trials complete, everyone but Laura becomes an external disciple. Laura, still needing another core, resolves to continue. The party, now recognized, can take on missions from the tribes' boards, provided they cooperate under the approval of a master.
