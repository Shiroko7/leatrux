Following their tense meeting with [[Bei Li'er]], the party gathered to formulate an alternative strategy, particularly after [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s revelation about his complicated history on the island. He confessed that before his downfall, he had actually managed to secure half of the needed funds through Mahjong. However, his initial inability to meet the expectations of various tribal powerbrokers had already soured many relationships. His subsequent gambling success only worsened matters, earning him powerful enemies across all three tribes and resulting in several failed assassination attempts.

The turning point came during his fateful match with [[Bei Li'er]]. His decisive loss marked the beginning of an unprecedented losing streak—one so dramatic that the crew strongly suspected a curse was at play. When they attempted to discuss potential connections between [[Bei Li'er]] and [[Umberlee]], mentioning both her and [[Ilmatera]] in their speculation, [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] suddenly collapsed unconscious—a reaction that only deepened their suspicions about supernatural interference.

This dramatic response drove the first step of their recovery plan: seeking out [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]]'s masters to investigate and potentially lift any malevolent influences affecting [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]].

From there, they would launch a carefully crafted campaign promoting the [[Fulh'ulbrech]] as an elite means of transportation. Their pitch would emphasize the ship's unique advantages: faster than swimming or flying, requiring no expenditure of personal energy, and offering valuable cultivation time during travel—a luxury particularly appealing to the island's status-conscious cultivators.

The party planned to secure [[Wang Dabao]]'s assistance in selling passenger seats and seek [[Lady Elowen]]'s backing to lend credibility to their venture. Meanwhile, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] would attempt to leverage [[Harpy]]'s connections within the [[The Shadow Sect|Shadow Sect]] to gather additional support. 

Their long-term vision extended beyond merely clearing the debt. If successful, they contemplated expanding into shipbuilding, potentially offering vessels to each master of the tribes. As for the [[Liberation Sect]], rather than joining one of the existing factions, they proposed creating their own, with [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]]'s masters potentially serving as the public faces of this new power bloc. Should they succeed in weakening [[Bei Li'er]]'s political position while clearing the debt, they hoped to draw other sect members to their cause.

The plan was ambitious, perhaps even audacious, but it offered a path forward that maintained their independence while potentially establishing them as a significant force on the [[Isle of Whispers]]—provided they could navigate the complex web of enemies [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s previous successes had created, and unravel the mysterious power that seemed to hold him in its grip.
