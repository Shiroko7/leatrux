Clutching [[Gio]]'s chest containing 5,000 gold pieces, [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] departed with his newfound elven companions aboard a small flying ship, headed for the casino. His sudden departure left the crew bewildered, prompting them to pursue him in hopes of preventing further gambling debts. Upon reaching the casino, they encountered strict security measures—no weapons, armor, or magical items allowed inside. While [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] rushed to acquire a bag of holding and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] returned to store his equipment, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] was forced to remove nearly a thousand gold pieces from his own bag of holding just to accommodate his and [[Gio]]'s items.

Inside, [[Gio]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] found [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] already deep in a mahjong game, drinking and gambling away with his companions. Their intervention was interrupted by a [[Liberation Sect]] member who recognized them, eager to share news about the casino's owner, [[Bei Li'er]]. This third rising master of the [[Liberation Sect]] had apparently struck a "golden fortuitous encounter" in the [[Aquagloom Abyss]], transforming from a merchant's daughter into a rising star. The sect disciple spoke with particular awe about her enhanced beauty following the encounter, though [[Gio]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]]'s attention fixed on the mention of a powerful artifact retrieved from an underwater temple.

The casino walls displayed halls of fame listing the establishment's greatest winners and losers. Notably, every player at [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s table appeared on the losing list. Despite their attempts to demonstrate the futility of gambling, they found themselves losing to [[Renzhuo]], ironically the casino's biggest loser turned dealer, who openly manipulated the games with shameless cunning.

Tension escalated when [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s patience finally snapped at [[Renzhuo]]'s blatant cheating. Their mutual accusations of past deceits erupted into violence, with [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] launching himself across the table. Though guards warned them to take the fight outside, the brawl continued until a mysterious dark dagger struck [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s neck, rendering him unconscious. Three black-robed assassins emerged from the shadows, their faces concealed.

The party, stripped of their usual armaments, fought desperately. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] resorted to improvised weapons and a borrowed dagger from [[Dhalia]], the bartender. A mysterious figure in a sombrero, introducing himself as [[Wang Dabao|Juan David De la Lluvia]] (though bearing a suspicious resemblance to [[Wang Dabao]]), attempted to assist but became distracted by his attractive elven companion. Under cover of magical darkness, the assassins succeeded in their grim task—[[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] lay dead before his friends could intervene. Though they managed to strike down one assailant, the others escaped with their weapons, revealing themselves to be mere projections rather than physical beings.

[[Bei Li'er]]'s appearance on the second floor coincided with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]'s use of the spell-storing ring's Revivify, saving [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s life in a display that left onlookers slack-jawed. The dramatic resurrection drew [[Bei Li'er]]'s immediate attention, her golden core cultivation emanating an aura that commanded instant respect from all present. Fixed particularly on [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] and [[Gio]], she demanded explanations, summoning the crew to the second floor for a private discussion.
