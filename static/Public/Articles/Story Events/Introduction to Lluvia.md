[[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]], [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]], and [[Grommash Thunderfist|Grommash]] visit the [[Tribe Lluvia]], guided by **[[Nami]]**, a servant of the tribe's matriarch **[[Selene Aeloria]]**. [[Tribe Lluvia]] focuses on mastering **water** and **wind essences** and has a strong affinity for sorceresses. Due to this magical inclination, they follow a **matriarchal system**, with women holding most of the power. Men in the tribe primarily handle farming and fishing, the latter being a dangerous yet respected profession due to the mysteries and powerful creatures of the surrounding sea.

The tribe's leadership comprises:

- **[[Selene Aeloria]]**: Matriarch and leader.
- **[[Faelara Rest]]**: Supreme Elder and Pillar of Wind.
- **[[Elaindra Raindew]]**: Supreme Elder and Pillar of Water.
