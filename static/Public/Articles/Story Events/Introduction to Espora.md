[[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] and [[Gio]] visit [[Tribe Espora]], where they are greeted by **[[Laura Bush]]**, the holy daughter of the tribe and granddaughter of its sovereign leader. The tribe specializes in **poison**, **wood**, and **acid essences**, but its members suffer from severe drug addiction, likely caused by the practitioners of the poison path.

The tribe's leadership comprises:

- **[[Zarvon Fungart]]**: Sovereign Leader and Pillar of Wood.
- **[[Ryndar Moldshade]]**: Supreme Elder and Pillar of Poison.
- **[[Orin Acidbranch]]**: Supreme Elder and Pillar of Acid.
    - Both Ryndar and Orin appear to be under Zarvonâ€™s control through spore cultivation.
