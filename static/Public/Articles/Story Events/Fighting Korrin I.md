The chosen ones' newfound mastery over the trial of fire's pocket dimension revealed a stark view of its labyrinth's final stage. Among the few dozen survivors of the original hundreds, they spotted [[Korrin]] and his followers approaching - bloodied, injured, but determined. Despite initial thoughts of ambush, their hesitation to engage gave way to a tense confrontation. [[Korrin]]'s passionate warnings against the island's influence fell on deaf ears, and his frustration erupted into violence with a declaration to thin the ranks of the island's supporters.

What followed was a battle that would swing wildly between triumph and despair. [[Korrin]]'s transformation into a young red dragon through his blood-infused [[dragonmark]] sent immediate shockwaves through the group. Fear scattered some - [[Laura Bush]] vanishing through a dimension door, [[Wang Dabao]] fleeing outright, while [[Lime]] could only cower and seek [[Nilo]]'s reassurance. Others stood their ground - [[Rachel Darm]] and [[Quill Rest]] launching into the attack, [[Marisella]] focusing on protection, and Lumina attempting to create an escape route through fog.

The dragon's scales proved impenetrable, and its first breath of fire demonstrated devastating power, claiming [[Lumina]]'s life instantly. [[Korrin]]'s elite followers pressed their advantage: [[Malek]]'s acid-enhanced strikes felled [[Rachel]], [[Llyrith]] exacted her revenge on [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] with a precise neck strike, [[Zara]] rained fire from nowhere, and [[Ravion]] nearly shattered [[Nilo]]'s bones.

Yet death itself seemed to bow to the will of the island, as fallen allies rose again and again. Above, [[Phudara]]'s illusory dragon form dwarfed [[Korrin]]'s transformation, a reminder of greater powers at play. When [[Lumina]] miraculously forced open an escape route, some took it - [[Lumina]] herself, [[Marisella]], and [[Lime]] fleeing to safety. [[Korrin]], growing desperate, resorted to swallowing [[Sylas]] whole, hoping to circumvent the island's protection.

The tide turned through moments of brilliant coordination: [[Gio]]'s qi-shattering strike guided by tremorsense alone, [[Rachel Darm|Rachel]]'s fog-dispelling blow that forced [[Korrin]] back to elven form, and the final coordinated assault by [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]. Victory found the party standing over their unconscious or dead opponents, the Liberation Sect thoroughly defeated.
