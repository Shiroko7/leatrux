## Team Aqua's Camp

Away from the others, Laura and Thallassios found a quiet moment to share their recent experiences. Thallassios spoke of Selune, who he claimed now resided within his blade, though his explanations carried a note of uncertainty that left Laura wondering about his mental state. She, in turn, offered brief glimpses of her time after the vortex incident in the Aquagloom Abyss, though she kept most details to herself.

The addition of Wang Dabao to their group brought an unexpected dynamic. The rotund bard initially presented himself as a spoiled, demanding presence, yet he gradually began to win favor with some of the party members through his candid discussions about the segregated nature of the Lluvia tribe and his personal grievances with Lady Elowen's group. His complaints, however, struck a nerve with Lumina, who belonged to that very circle. Her verbal attacks on Wang revealed the deep divisions that ran through their tribe's society.

The group watched with mixed feelings as Wang isolated himself from them, his reliability still in question. In a peculiar display, he consumed candy from his magical coat before requesting a dagger, claiming he needed it to craft a replacement for his lost wooden flute. Laura provided one, only to witness him using his own sharpened teeth to carve the wood instead. The result of his unusual crafting method was surprisingly melodious—his skillful playing brought a temporary peace to their troubled minds, though the moment was interrupted by the loud growling of his stomach. Wang's relationship with food proved as complex as his personality. Despite his constant complaints about their provisions, he would inevitably consume everything offered to him, exhibiting both pickiness and gluttony in equal measure.

Concerned about Thallassios's prospects within the tribe, Wang Dabao approached him with an unusual gift—a carefully crafted wooden nose attached to what appeared to be Groucho glasses. He explained, with complete seriousness, that the artificial facial hair would make Thallassios appear more manly and improve his standing with the tribe's women. Lumina, witnessing this exchange, burst into unexpected laughter at the sight. Despite—or perhaps because of—their comical appearance, Thallassios decided to wear the glasses.

One notable evening, after their brush with ambush, he claimed to have caught a rare magical fish native to the Aquagloom Abyss. His lack of culinary skill led to an amusing collaboration with Thallassios, though their combined efforts still resulted in a less than perfect preparation. Laura steadfastly refused to partake in the fish, a decision that prompted Wang to express his concerns quietly to Thallassios about its wasted cultivation benefits. The following morning, Lumina took charge of properly preparing the remaining fish, though Laura maintained her abstinence from the meal. Lumina and Wang shared a private conversation beyond the others' hearing as they were still asleep.
