[[Phudara]]'s private meetings with the chosen ones unfolded with a peculiar mix of formality and awkward tension. She attempted to make each feel uniquely valuable, though her efforts at subtle manipulation often stumbled into transparent flattery. Each conversation came with an inheritance offer and an invitation to the dark sect, delivered with varying degrees of grace.

Her discussion with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] about ocean travel meandered between practical advice and cryptic warnings. While insisting on the necessity of an [[Umberlee]] cleric for any serious voyage, she seemed oddly casual about the sea goddess's evil reputation, essentially suggesting that divine wrath was only a concern if one managed to specifically anger the deity. The advice, though valuable, left Laura with more worries than before.

[[Nilo]]'s meeting centered on his aberrant [[dragonmark]], though [[Phudara]]'s limited knowledge became increasingly apparent as the conversation progressed. The revelation that his mark prevented nascent soul fruit formation led to an awkwardly presented choice between removal or suppression through her essence of life, with neither option seeming particularly appealing.

The encounter with [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] took an unexpected turn into magical discipline, his previous allegiance to [[Marisella]] earning him a supernatural beating. His stubborn determination seemed to both irritate and impress [[Phudara]], though it didn't prevent her from simply declaring his earth inheritance without the pretense of choice she offered the others.

[[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]]'s ambitious plans regarding [[Umberlee]] met with a mixture of cautionary tales and backhanded encouragement. While explaining the sea goddess's formidable position among god ghosts, [[Phudara]]'s mentions of internal disciples' ghost-fighting capabilities seemed to inadvertently fuel rather than dampen his resolve.

[[Gio]]'s session devolved into a series of misunderstandings and clarifications about sect duties, with [[Phudara]] trying to downplay cosmic responsibilities while emphasizing local island matters. Her dismissal of his elder's divine wine recipe as mere deception led to an unexpected tangent about the isle of ghosts, which she suggested might be the legendary island of the end he soughtâ€”or perhaps not.

When the group finally reconvened, their shared agreement to temporarily ally with the dark sect came with the collectively uncomfortable task of recruiting other chosen ones as external disciples. The awkwardness of their new role as sect recruiters was palpable, each processing their individual strange encounters with [[Phudara]] while contemplating how to approach their delicate new assignment.
