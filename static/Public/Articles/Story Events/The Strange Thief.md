While the [[The Goat|goat]] announced its departure to handle "business" in the [[Lluvia tribe]], a concerned [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]] pursued it, arriving too late to prevent what was to come. Meanwhile, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] was discussing with [[Faelara Rest|Faelara]] about a series of mysterious thefts plaguing the tribe, with magical items and materials vanishing from their stocks. [[Faelara Rest|Faelara]] directed [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] to pay respects to the paintings of previous wind pillars, expensive works gifted by a talented wooden path artist.

[[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]'s inspection revealed something unusualâ€”one painting was covered in ants. Following the trail, she discovered the painting was a fake, only to be confronted by [[Galea]], a senior sister who warned her away from the investigation. The arrival of [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]] interrupted their tense exchange, with [[Galea]] departing after casting verbal barbs at the newcomers.

The investigation expanded as they enlisted [[Lumina]]'s help. They learned that even [[Lady Elowen]] had been affected by the thefts, finding her in a rage and threatening her servant [[Fin]], who joined their search to clear his name. The group identified several suspects: [[Jin]], a crippled former master; [[Kin]], a young merchant; [[Min]], a quiet fisherman; and [[Lin]], a herbalist. During their investigation, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] purchased a Silverthorn flower from [[Lin]]'s shop as a cover, later giving it to [[Nilo]] to maintain appearances.

Following the goat's trail led them to [[Kin]], whose house reeked of disenchantment materials. There, they discovered [[Elandor]]'s involvement. In the ensuing confrontation, a series of catastrophic mishaps left [[Nilo]] severely injured and poisoned, with [[Elandor]] being forcefully propelled away by the [[The Goat|goat]]'s intervention.

Rather than pursue [[Elandor]], the group made a shocking discovery: the goat had orchestrated a vast network of nearly a hundred mortals to steal powerful artifacts and rare materials. Faced with the likelihood that the true culprits would face execution to appease public outrage, they made a morally questionable decision. They chose to frame [[Jin]], whose position as a former master made her a believable scapegoat. With the [[The Goat|goat]]'s assistance, they altered memories to fabricate a confrontation and capture. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]], disturbed by this decision, requested to be excluded from the deception.

In an unexpected turn of events, all the mortals the goat had recruited for its theft network ultimately joined the crew of the [[Fulh'ulbrech]], finding a new purpose and refuge from their past activities. This addition significantly expanded the ship's crew, though the moral implications of their collective deception would continue to weigh on some of the party members.
