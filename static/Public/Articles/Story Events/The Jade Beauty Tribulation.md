As [[Branor]] departed amidst thunderous applause, a profound silence descended upon the arena. The multitude sensed the approach of a celestial presence – [[Su Yaolan]], the supreme jade beauty of the [[Lluvia Tribe]], was arriving.

Like a mountain goddess descending from her sacred peaks, she floated down from the exalted viewing platforms. Each footfall seemed to caress rather than touch the earth beneath, leaving traces of spiritual essence that ordinary cultivators could only dream of perceiving. Her jade-hemmed robes danced with ethereal grace, revealing shoulders as flawless as the finest porcelain, their milky perfection unmarred by worldly imperfections. Spirals of azure spiritual energy coiled about her form like flowing streams returning to their source, marking her as one blessed by the heavens themselves.

The once-raucous coliseum fell into reverent stillness. Thousands of breaths halted simultaneously, as if the crowd feared disturbing the cosmic mandate unfolding before their mortal eyes. Sunlight, as though recognizing a superior celestial body, gathered around her delicate features, casting a divine radiance that humbled even the proudest cultivators present.

With the graceful poise that belied her middle stage of foundation establishment cultivation, she extended a jade-like hand before [[Nilo]], revealing the treasure nestled within her palm. Was it an artifact forged from the essence of fallen stars? A talisman inscribed with the Dao patterns of creation? Or merely a token whose true value could only be comprehended by those whose spiritual insight had pierced the veil of mundane perception?

She spoke but few words, for those who have tasted the fruits of true cultivation need not waste breath on excessive speech. The profound weight of her gesture alone was sufficient to send ripples through the dao hearts of all witnesses, stirring both admiration and the poisonous shoots of envy.

For on this day, the celestial arrangement of fate had cast its inscrutable gaze upon [[Nilo]]. As ancient sages have proclaimed since time immemorial: "When immortals bestow favor, mortal calamity often follows." Without turning, [[Nilo]] could sense the blade-like gazes piercing his back, each one charged with murderous intent sharp enough to sever mountains. A tempest of jealousy was gathering, its pressure weighing upon his meridians like the force of nine celestial mountains.

Her brief visitation had been to present [[The Heartflow Veil]] – a sacred treasure of the [[Lluvia Tribe]] rarely bestowed upon outsiders. This token of profound respect and karmic connection was meant to honor [[Nilo]]'s meritorious deeds within the tribe's domains, yet to observing eyes, such an extraordinary gift could easily be misconstrued as something far more intimate, perhaps even a declaration of dao companionship.

As [[Su Yaolan]] departed with steps as light as morning mist, the restrained fury of the multitude erupted like a volcano suppressed for ten thousand years. Countless voices clamored for [[Nilo]]'s defeat, demanding he prove himself worthy of such unmerited fortune. Though he initially resisted this tide of hostility, wishing to maintain his healer's dignity, [[Wang Dabao]] forcefully counseled him with barely concealed resentment gleaming in his eyes: _"You must stand firm and fight a hundred battles—no, at least eighty-eight thousand confrontations will be necessary. Otherwise, these jackals will never cease their harassment. Each victory must be decisive, each defeat you hand out must serve as both warning and lesson."_ His words carried the weight of experience, yet the specific number he proposed betrayed his own buried grudges, as if he had calculated exactly how many humiliations would satisfy his sense of cosmic balance.

When the first challenger leapt into the arena, [[Nilo]]'s resolve finally crystallized. With a single movement that seemed to contain both supreme mercy and uncompromising judgment, he dispatched his opponent. More followed, each falling before his unexpected prowess, though several nearly breached his defenses with techniques honed through bitter cultivation.

From amidst the crowd, a silver-haired maiden observed with eyes that seemed to pierce the veils of fate itself. [[Lumina]], wielding the profound arts of celestial divination, subtly adjusted the strands of probability, weaving a path of victory through the chaos of combat for [[Nilo]].

As he continued to overcome challenger after challenger, another distinguished figure appeared – [[Shui Yuan'hua]], petite in stature yet commanding in presence, her approach heralded by the fragrance of celestial blossoms. This former inheritor of the [[Trial of Fire]] stood at the perfection stage of foundation establishment, her cultivation having reached its zenith before the inevitable breakthrough to core formation. With authority that brooked no defiance, she halted the proceedings, warning that continued conflict would only damage the dao hearts of all involved, turning what should be a lesson in humility into a cycle of pointless enmity.
