## Team Aqua's Journey

In the midst of the bizarre forest's trembling, Lumina found herself adrift in confusion. Mere moments ago, she had been preparing to make a favorable impression on Lady Elowen alongside her elder sisters. Now, she stood beside unexpected companions, her carefully laid plans scattered like leaves in a storm. As a student of astrology, she had mapped countless possible futures for this trial, yet none had prepared her for this reality. The alien sky above spoke only of tragedy to her trained eyes.

Together with Laura and Thallassios, Lumina began their journey toward the trial's third phase. Their first test came in the form of a fearsome manticore, which they dispatched with surprising ease. As they pressed onward, they encountered an ethereal sight: a permanent aurora hanging in the sky, composed of the merged souls of an ill-fated elven scouting party. Their final report, etched in the ethereal lights, warned of their leader's transformation and pleaded with future explorers to end his "eternal loneliness."

Their path led them to an peculiar encounter with a merchant who called herself Shui Ling. Despite being of the initial master stage, she seemed stranded in the middle of nowhere, offering trades with an unsettling demeanor. It was here they discovered an unconscious man from the Lluvia tribe. While Laura acquired a flying broom from the merchant, Thallassios made what many would consider a fool's bargain—trading his nose for a seemingly worthless common horn. Lumina, however, saw an opportunity in the stranger's presence. She traded one of her precious magical books to save the unconscious man's life, and made another, secret exchange with the merchant who seemed capable of communicating only through pre-prepared responses.

The saved man introduced himself as Wang Dabao, a fatty bard from the fishing guild whose jovial demeanor barely concealed deeper mysteries. As they continued their journey, they discovered the remnants of an ancient civilization. Though most structures had crumbled to dust, they recovered two significant finds: a quiver of cursed arrows and a pair of magical darkness-piercing goggles, both carrying their own sinister enchantments.

Their relative peace was shattered when members of the Espora tribe ambushed them, using the corpses of Lluvia tribe members as bait. To Lumina's horror, she recognized the dead as her elder sisters—the very ones she was meant to take the trial with. In a cold fury, she ensured their attackers met a similar fate, collecting their heads as grim trophies to present to her master.

The group pressed on, facing and defeating a Shambling Mound that bore traces of having once been a cultivator. From its remains, they claimed a lightning-infused armor. Yet their greatest challenge awaited near the mountain's approach: a massive wolf puppet that toyed with them like a cat with mice, nearly ending their journey permanently.

Salvation came from an unexpected quarter—a group from the Liberation Sect. Among them was Grimmy, who offered a surprising apology to Thallassios, having gained a new understanding of the trials faced by men in the Lluvia tribe. Lumina maintained a tense silence as she faced her former captors, powerless to act in the moment. Wang Dabao's familiar greetings to several sect members, despite their different tribal origins, added another layer of mystery to his character. In the background, Llyrith's presence went unacknowledged by Thallassios, who seemed to look right through their former opponent.
