## The Chupacabra Incident

A peculiar side quest emerged when the tribes reported a demonic beast terrorizing the area, believed to be the mythical "Chupacabra." The party, concerned about their missing carnivorous goat, began their investigation in the forests of the Espora Tribe. Their search led them to an unusual sight: a colony of ants forming mysterious patterns around magical excrement. As they examined the scene, they spotted Nilo's goat running in the distance, but before they could pursue, the ants grew to enormous size upon contact with the magical substance, forcing the party to flee.

During their pursuit, they encountered Landor and Goon, two others tracking the same creature. Despite their initial reluctance, the newcomers joined forces with the party. Their chase led them through increasingly dangerous territory, including a region of deadly poisonous plants where Nilo and Gio discovered rare materials. A mishap occurred when Goon's sneeze triggered the toxic flora, forcing another retreat.

The pursuit took another turn when they stumbled upon Laura Bush conversing with an unknown figure in Sylvan. The encounter ended in a massive explosion, leaving the party injured. Before fleeing, Laura Bush "accidentally" dropped a magical wand. Exhausted and damaged, the group pressed on rather than resting, entering an even more treacherous area where they encountered displacer beasts. The combination of toxic exposure and exhaustion led to violent hallucinations, ending with the party losing consciousness.

They awakened in a camp under the care of Zyrenia Serpentsoul, heir to the Serpentsoul clan. She took particular interest in Nilo, recognizing their shared condition—she, like him, possessed mixed blood, though in her case from her clan's practice of merging their bloodline with powerful serpent monsters. Her white hair marked her as exceptionally talented, though she too faced the challenges of not being pure-blooded. While tending to Nilo, she explained how she had witnessed them being defended by the goat during their unconscious encounters with various monsters. She requested that Nilo and Gio form a group with her younger brother, Vaelith Serpentsoul, a chosen one of their generation, for the upcoming Trial of Fire. The party left without committing to her request.

The chase culminated in a final encounter with the goat, where Landor and Goon were also present. Nilo finally managed to communicate with the creature, who explained its actions were driven by hunger and even offered to eat Thallassios—an offer Nilo declined. The goat then shed and regrew its horns, offering one to the party as proof of their completed quest.

The adventure took a dark turn when Nilo, confronted with a partially eaten boar carcass, experienced an overwhelming compulsion. To his companions' horror, he consumed the creature's heart, driven by an intrusive thought he couldn't resist. This act brought an unexpected revelation: the consumption satisfied a deep-seated hunger and bloodlust he had long struggled to control, suggesting a darker aspect to his nature.
