Before they can make their choice, a terrible crisis strikes. The ship is attacked by an **abyssal kraken**, its monstrous tentacles rising from the depths of the ocean, attempting to crush the ship and drag the crew down into the dark waters. Chaos erupts on deck. [[Vexa]], restrained by the crew, struggles against her bonds as the group fights to survive. **[[Marisella]]**, in a rare moment of defiance against the sea’s gods, prays fervently to **[[Lathender]]**, asking for blessings in the face of the oncoming storm. The crew watches helplessly as **[[Satlypaws]]** is pulled under by one of the kraken’s tentacles, his screams swallowed by the abyss.

Amidst the chaos, **[[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thallassios]]** dives into the fray, using his aquatic prowess to save several crew members who have fallen overboard. Meanwhile, **[[Rudy Blagsta]]**, the hobgoblin leader of the fishermen, is flung from the deck by a lashing tentacle and barely manages to grab hold of a rope on the ship's outer hull. As he hangs precariously above the churning waves, **[[Gio]]** spots him through the storm. With an impressive display of strength and precision, **[[Gio]]** hauls **[[Rudy]]** back aboard, saving his life just as the ship creaks ominously under the kraken’s relentless assault. A shaken but grateful **Rudy** nods in silent thanks before retreating to help others.

The ship buckles further, and the crew attempts to abandon ship, but the situation worsens. **[[Vexa]]** is thrown into the ocean, dragged away by one of the kraken's appendages. The crew is scattered in the chaos, and **[[Nilo]]**, following close behind, notices **[[Ilmatera|Illira]]** is still by his side. They descend to the lower decks, where they discover the body of **[[Umberlee|Emberlee]]**, her form oddly serene in death. **[[Nilo]]**, driven by his hatred for the quartermaster, stabs her in the throat with a knife, seeking some twisted form of catharsis. But something feels off. **[[Umberlee|Emberlee]]**, is carrying strange magic items—among them a ring that refuses to come off, no matter how hard **[[Nilo]]** tugs.

As [[Nilo]] finally manages to remove the ring, he is horrified to see **[[Umberlee|Emberlee]]'s** eyes snap open, her gaze unblinking, filled with malice. In a panic, he places the ring back, only to realize that **[[Umberlee|Emberlee]]** is not truly dead—she is **[[Umberlee|Emberlee]]**, the goddess of the sea. The revelation shakes [[Nilo]] to his core, and in the moment of her awakening, the kraken retreats in terror, sensing the presence of the goddess.

[[Ilmatera|Illira]], standing by [[Nilo]], reveals that she is not just any girl—she is **[[Ilmatera]]**, the goddess of martyrdom. In that moment, a fierce, divine battle erupts between the two goddesses, **[[Umberlee]]** trying to tear down the ship, while **[[Ilmatera]]** desperately protects it. Despite her efforts, [[Ilmatera]] is at a disadvantage, though she manages to seize something from **[[Umberlee]]'s** corpse: a **bag of holding**. She hands it to the crew, offering them the chance to fight back.

Inside the bag are powerful artifacts, but the crew struggles to understand their purpose. They retrieve a skull with a faint green hue, and upon activating its powers, nothing seems to happen—until, by chance, **[[Gio]]**, with his infamous luck, discovers a **Ring of Wishes** hidden among the items. With a single wish, **[[Gio]]** asks for the ship’s safety, and the **genie** in the ring responds, scattering the magical items across the sea to delay **[[Umberlee]]** and buy the crew precious time.

Now, with the kraken momentarily distracted, the crew faces a race to find land— In **[[Amaterra]]**, the gods cannot tread the land. **[[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]** and **[[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]** work together to triangulate their position by the stars, using a star map artifact. Their search is guided by a final act of sacrifice: **[[Thistle]]'s** essence, taken from his corpse, is used to complete the map. As the crew sails toward the unknown, the weight of their choices and the true nature of the gods they’ve encountered will shape their fate in the days ahead.
