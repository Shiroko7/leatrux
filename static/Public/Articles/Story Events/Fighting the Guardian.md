## Fighting the Guardian

The day of battle began with Nilo's desperate gambit—consuming his stored crocodile heart to break through to the quasi-adept level. The transformation filled him with an unsettling surge of aggression and bloodlust, even as the rest of their forces took their positions in carefully planned formations, with scout groups moving ahead to locate their target.

They never heard from the scouts again. Their deaths were felt as mere tremors before true devastation struck.

Mu Youqing appeared in the sky like a bolt of lightning, his mere presence shattering their external barrier. The cultivators maintaining it collapsed, coughing blood as they realized with horror that his attack had cursed them. Many died in that first instant, their lives extinguished before they could even comprehend what had happened.

The battle erupted with Youqing darting into their midst. Despite their numbers, most attacks barely scratched him, the difference in cultivation realms rendering their efforts futile. Only a select few posed any real threat: the spell formations, Korrin and his elite adepts, and surprisingly, Gio. Thallassios joined their ranks as he activated his Flametongue, his power amplified by Selune's energy flowing through the Frostreaver.

Youqing's counterattack was devastating. Thallassios suffered grievous wounds, and others fell before his might. Yet the formations held, barely surviving each impact. Korrin and Ren, the formation specialist, began to make progress with their sealing technique. Victory seemed within reach—until everything collapsed.

The formations shattered without warning. A new figure appeared, holding an unconscious Ren: another Mu Youqing, but this one radiated a dignified presence that made the first seem like a pale imitation. Gone was the guardian's hint of madness, replaced by cold arrogance as he questioned their audacity in challenging him. His words cut deeper than any blade—they had barely defeated his clone with hundreds of cultivators, and even then, only a handful could inflict any damage.

With a single finger, he disarmed Thallassios, sending both him and the Frostreaver flying hundreds of feet through the air. A massive shadow spread from the main body, commanding all vegetation in its reach. Plants writhed to life, seizing anyone within their grasp.

Korrin's command cut through the chaos: "Run! The operation has failed. If even one of you reaches the third stage and claims the inheritance, we might save everyone by concluding this trial!" As cultivators fled for their lives, Korrin underwent a shocking transformation. His body expanded into that of a massive dragon, preparing to face Mu Youqing alone.

Nilo and Laura felt the transformation in their very beings, their dragonmarks resonating with Korrin's dragon form. They could only look back in awe as they ran, witnessing a clash of powers beyond their comprehension.
