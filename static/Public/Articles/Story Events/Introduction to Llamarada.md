[[Nilo]] and [[Marisella]], along with the goat, visit [[Tribe Llamarada]]. They are introduced to the tribe by siblings **[[Rena]]** and **[[Oxitee]]**. The tribe struggles with limited resources, especially during periods of volcanic inactivity. However, with the volcano showing signs of life again, the tribe has become increasingly busy.

Tribe Llamarada specializes in **martial arts** and to a lesser extent, **fire sorcery**, mastering **fire**, **metal**, and **earth essences**. Competition for resources is fierce, with thievery and conflict being commonplace.

The tribe's leadership comprises:

- **[[Thornor Bramblehelm]]**: Patriarch and Pillar of Metal.
- **[[Morwen Darm]]**: Supreme Elder and Pillar of Fire.
- **[[Talon Scorch]]**: Supreme Elder and Pillar of Fire.
- The tribe currently lacks a Pillar of Earth.
