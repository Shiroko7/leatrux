[[Wang Dabao|Juan]] seized upon [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]]'s suggestion with characteristic enthusiasm, immediately elevating the concept beyond its practical origins. The three men huddled together, their conversation growing increasingly animated as [[Wang Dabao|Juan]] outlined his vision: they should fight in the arena explicitly for [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]'s love, creating the maximum dramatic spectacle. His eyes gleamed with the potential entertainment value, completely overlooking the practical complications—namely that [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] remained at the initiate level, and [[Wang Dabao|Juan]] himself would rather die than risk public embarrassment in a martial contest he couldn't win.

Their solution led them to the [[Llamarada Tribe]] where they interrupted [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]'s seclusion. The dwarf regarded them with the weary expression of someone whose meditation had been broken for dubious reasons. When presented with the proposition to battle [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] in the arena, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] asked the one question they hadn't considered: would [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] approve of such plans? His refusal to participate sent them back to the [[Lluvia Tribe]] with one fewer contestant than they'd hoped.

Undeterred by this setback, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] proceeded to the arena, his medical supplies at the ready. His position near the fighting grounds would allow him to efficiently collect blood from the wounded—a pragmatic approach to his ritual preparations. When [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] spotted the returning party, [[Wang Dabao|Juan]] performed his signature vanishing act, melting away before explanations became necessary.

Upon reaching the arena, they discovered where [[Wang Dabao]] had disappeared to—he stood with a group of bards, instruments poised as the fighters prepared for their matches. The rotund musician played with unexpected delicacy, his fingers coaxing a romantic melody from his instrument before launching into a poem ostensibly dedicated to a silver thorn. With a flourish of magic, he conjured a bouquet of copper flowers as visual accompaniment, the flattering verses gradually revealing themselves as an ode to [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]. The announcement was clear—the upcoming combatants would fight for the honor of courting her.

The handsome servants of [[Lady Elowen]], [[Ael]] and [[Leon]], stepped forward as the first contestants. Their declarations of passionate love were matched only by their lamentations at having to fight one another as sworn brothers. Despite these protestations, neither hesitated as they began their elegant swordplay, circling each other with practiced precision.

As the duel extended beyond [[Wang Dabao|Wang]]'s patience threshold, he began making increasingly obvious signals for [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] to intervene. Finding herself suddenly illuminated by the arena's focusing crystals, she rose to the occasion with appropriate dramatic flair, halting the combat with a declaration that she had already made her decision. She skillfully withheld the details, maintaining an air of mystery that heightened the tension.

The spectacle escalated as [[Branor]], one of the [[Lluvia Tribe]]'s rare male cultivators, advanced into the arena. Raising his single blade skyward, he delivered an impassioned speech about his struggles within the matriarchal society, how his pursuit of swordsmanship had been a quest for meaning, only to realize it was all to bridge the distance between himself and [[Laura]]. He challenged any who would stand between them, his delivery occasionally faltering.

From his position among the wounded, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] noticed [[Branor]] surreptitiously glancing at script notes hidden within his clothing, explaining the awkward pauses in his performance. The day's entertainment continued as [[Branor]] demonstrated exceptional swordsmanship, defeating challenger after challenger. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]] observed with quiet satisfaction, mentally calculating that he was approaching the halfway mark in his blood collection efforts.
