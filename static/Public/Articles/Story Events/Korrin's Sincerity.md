## Korrin's Sincerity

When Korrin finally made contact with the party, his approach was one of careful diplomacy. He expressed genuine remorse for their previous conflicts, attributing them to unfortunate misunderstandings. To demonstrate his sincerity, he presented each member with a powerful magical item, carefully selected to match their abilities. Other sect members followed suit, showering the group with attention.

Among these gifts, Laura's stood out for its personal touch—a ring of spell storing with her name delicately engraved upon its surface. Her inspection revealed two spells bound to it: an unknown 6th-level enchantment worked into the ring itself, and a 5th-level spell stored within. Though she attuned to the ring, she approached it with caution, choosing not to trigger the stored spell.

That night, the ring's true purpose revealed itself. The Contingency spell activated, launching Laura into a magical dream where she found herself standing before her old house in her hometown. There, Korrin waited, seated at a piano—a detail that immediately raised Laura's suspicions.

His attempt to address her as a member of House Aesio met with unexpected resistance; Laura's apparent ignorance about her own dragonmark caught him off guard, though he maintained his composure. Taking this revelation in stride, he shifted to a more fundamental explanation about the true nature of dragonmarks and the current political landscape.

The truth he unveiled was intricate and disturbing. The noble houses, he explained, were locked in subtle warfare, their very existence threatened by a crucial detail: houses whose origin dragons had perished faced potential extinction. Both House Aesio and his own House Veridis stood in this precarious position. His proposal was direct—cooperation offered their only path to survival, as trust had become a rare commodity in their world.

But this political revelation was merely the surface of deeper, more fundamental truths about their world. The planet itself, Korrin explained, defied normal celestial mechanics. Rather than orbiting a fixed star, it wandered between universes, its path occasionally influenced but never fully captured by the suns it passed. The very geography of their world proved equally mutable, shaped and reshaped by the rising and falling of dragon rules.

The recent appearance of a new moon hung over these revelations like an ominous shadow—a bad omen, according to those who studied such things. Korrin spoke of a gathering storm, yet maintained that his mission held the potential to alter their fate's trajectory.

The dream ended leaving Laura adrift in a sea of uncertainties. The foundations of her understanding had been shaken, replaced with troubling questions about whom to trust and what path to follow. Korrin's revelations had not so much illuminated her way forward as revealed the complexity of the choices that lay before her.
