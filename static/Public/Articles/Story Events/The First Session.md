# The First Session

Six months after setting sail, the crew of the expedition ship has settled into a rhythm, each member carving out their own role in the ongoing voyage. As the night of a rare astronomical event approaches, the crew's stories intertwine, revealing their strengths and flaws.

**[[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]** and **[[Thistle]]** are in the cabin, discussing a celestial phenomenon set to occur that evening. If Thistle’s calculations are correct, the event could revolutionize their understanding of the stars. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] is filled with anticipation, knowing that this breakthrough could change everything, while [[Thistle]] remains absorbed in the math and figures, trusting that his theories will prove true.

Above on the deck, **[[Gio]]** rests against the railing, watching the sky and the antics of his fellow crew members. Nearby, **[[Sylva Windwhisper]]**, the aarakocra lookout, lazily ignores her post, instead fiddling with a piece of driftwood. **[[Silverscale]]**, the kobold sailmaster, is sprawled on a coil of rope, tossing wooden marbles in the air, utterly detached from the work at hand. [[Gio]] shakes his head with a wry smile—though they’re entertaining, their reluctance to carry out their duties often leaves him picking up the slack.

At the helm, **[[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]** stands beside **[[Grommash Thunderfist|Grommash]]**, the half-orc helmsman, who is more comfortable with the ship's course than any navigator should be. [[Grommash Thunderfist|Grommash]] admits to **[[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]]** that he has no formal sailing experience. Instead, he navigates purely on instinct, convinced that his destiny guides him. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] listens quietly, understanding that, for all of [[Grommash Thunderfist|Grommash]]'s bravado, a deep unease lingers beneath his words. No one else on the crew seems to question the captain’s confidence, but [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] knows better than most that blind trust can lead to dangerous outcomes.

In the lower decks, **[[Nilo]]** attempts to clean one of the ship's cannons under the direction of **[[Vexa]]**, the red tiefling gunner. Vexa, who’s more focused on shifting responsibility than learning her craft, orders [[Nilo]] to handle the task. But things go awry as [[Nilo]] mishandles the cannon, resulting in an explosion that could have been catastrophic. **Emberlee**, the elven strict quartermaster, appears almost immediately, punishing [[Nilo]] for the mistake, as she always does, with a swift and harsh reprimand. The crew knows that Emberlee’s punishments are as much a part of ship life as the salt air and the waves, but that doesn’t make them any less painful.

Elsewhere, **[[Private/Primal Era Campaign/Private/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thallassios]]** finds himself caught by the fishermen as the crew's suspicions grow. His intentions remain unclear, and the tension surrounding his presence builds. After some questioning, **[[Umberlee|Emberlee]]** grudgingly allows him to stay on board, though it’s clear that his inclusion in the expedition is not without its risks.

As the crew prepares for the night’s event, the undercurrents of ambition, fear, and uncertainty ripple through the ship. No one knows what lies ahead, but each crew member plays their part—whether out of duty, destiny, or sheer force of will. The night promises a pivotal moment for the crew, and the stars themselves may offer the answers to questions they haven’t even begun to ask.
