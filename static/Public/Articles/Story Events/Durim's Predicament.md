Arriving at the ship, the party was struck by the unusual lack of repair activity. [[Durim Stonehammer]], typically obsessed with progress, was lounging with his new island companions, including several attentive elven women. His demeanor had shifted dramatically from his usual intense focus to an uncharacteristic relaxation. Leading them to the Stern castle for privacy, he shared both good news and bad: while half the ship's funding had been secured through others' efforts, repairs had ground to a halt due to his gambling addiction. He had managed to accumulate a staggering debt of 200,000 gold pieces – more than the original repair costs – through daily borrowing from the gambling den in desperate attempts to recover his losses. The party's shock only deepened upon learning of the 1% daily interest rate. As their discussion concluded, [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] checked the time and hurriedly excused himself – the gambling den was about to open for the day.

Their meeting was interrupted by news that the [[The Goat|Goat]] awaited them in the lower deck's old infirmary. There, they found an extraordinary scene: [[Kin]] methodically disenchanting magical items under the [[The Goat|Goat]]'s casual supervision, creating a mountain of blue magical dust. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Nilo|Nilo]]'s analysis revealed its value as a universal spell component replacement – knowledge they immediately put to use by storing a Revivify spell in [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]]'s ring. The room represented nearly half a million gold pieces transformed into this mystical powder, with only a few minor magical items remaining to be processed.

The conversation turned to the possibility of selling [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s belongings at an upcoming major auction among the three tribes before the [[Infernoheart Citadel]] expedition. However, this discussion revealed an unexpected common interest among them in cultivating both fire and poison paths. In a moment of ironic sincerity, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]] launched into an impassioned speech about trust and sharing secrets – even as everyone present carefully guarded their own numerous confidences. The meeting concluded with practical planning for the auction, though the unspoken truths hung heavy in the air.
