While walking through the tribe the next morning, [[Grommash Thunderfist|Grommash]] notices a beautiful mature woman and impulsively asks a nearby "girl" about her identity. To his shock, the "girl" turns out to be **[[Quill Rest]]**, the holy son of the tribe, and one of the rare male cultivators. [[Quill Rest|Quill]] is highly respected and popular within the cultivation world.

Offended by [[Grommash Thunderfist|Grommash]]â€™s remarks, [[Quill Rest|Quill]] uses his cultivation to suppress him and declares [[Grommash Thunderfist|Grommash]] banished not only from Tribe Lluvia but also from all three great tribes. Feeling humiliated, [[Grommash Thunderfist|Grommash]] flees to the mountains. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Laura Cassini|Laura]] and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Herng Azurit|Herng]], unbothered by his absence, do not pursue him.
