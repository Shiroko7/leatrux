[[Laura Bush]] offers the visitors drugs, which [[Gio]] accepts, leaving him unconscious and hallucinating. [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] refuses but accompanies [[Laura Bush|Laura]] to a secret location. She leads him to a **yellow acid pool**, where she "accidentally" pushes him in, nearly killing him. [[Laura Bush|Laura]] persuades him it was a mistake, and [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] returns to sleep beside Gio.

The next day, [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] awakens with his skin covered in a yellowish crust that restricts his movement, while [[Gio]] is weakened from the lingering effects of the **Wish** spell. They are rescued by **[[Vanya]]** and **[[Elira]]**, young siblings and masters of the tribe, who reveal a grave secret: **[[Zarvon Fungart]]** has cultivated spores that infiltrate the brain and allow him to manipulate others. [[Vanya]] and [[Elira]] are among the few unaffected and believe the other tribes may also be at risk. They enlist [[Public/Articles/PCs/Thalassios Euphasath|Thalassios]] and [[Gio]]'s help in finding a cure for [[Zarvon Fungart|Zarvon]]â€™s disease.
