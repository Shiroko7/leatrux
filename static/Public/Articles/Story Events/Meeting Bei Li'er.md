In the private room on the second floor, [[Bei Li'er]] dismisses the party's desperate pleas regarding [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s debt with a casual wave of her hand. Instead, she fixes her attention on matters she deems more consequential—specifically the [[Liberation Sect]] and its future. Her gaze lingers particularly on [[Nilo]] and [[Gio]], aware of [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s personal selection of them for the sect's echelon group.

The party's uncertainty becomes palpable as they grapple with this decision, especially given [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s death and his now-unfulfillable promises. [[Bei Li'er]] reveals the sect's internal power structure: three distinct factions, each led by one of [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s chosen echelons. First stands [[Yu Wei]], commanding a formidable martial arts dojo. Second is [[Sister Mei]], who controls the [[Tribe Llamarada]]'s largest medical guard. Finally, [[Bei Li'er]] herself represents the third rising faction, wielding considerable merchant influence.

Her warning comes wrapped in silk but carries steel beneath—while the factions maintain a veneer of alliance, each plots to claim [[Korrin Flameheart|Korrin]]'s legacy. She suggests that as his chosen ones, they would be safer aligned with any of the three factions, despite their leaders' hidden agendas. Her offer dangles tantalizingly: join her side, and [[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]]'s debt vanishes.

The conversation reveals a deeper complication—[[Durim Stonehammer|Durim]] has surrendered the rights to the ship's blueprints to [[Bei Li'er]] until his debt is cleared, effectively binding him from any work on the vessel. When pressed about the ship's importance, [[Bei Li'er]]'s response drips with condescension. She sarcastically suggests they could simply swim, fly, or walk away from the island—a reflection of the islanders' disconnected worldview, where the weak perish and the strong survive. Her casual dismissal of the ocean's vastness betrays a profound ignorance of the world beyond their shores.

The party departs with their spirits dampened but resolute, knowing they must carefully weigh their options between securing their ship's future and forging alliances in this land where strength dictates all.
