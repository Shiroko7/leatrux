### **Amulet of Curse Warding**

**Base Bid: 1,500 gp**  
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

While wearing this amulet, you have advantage on saving throws against curses. In addition, you can use an action to cast _remove curse_ from the amulet. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.


### **Amulet of Dual Essence**

**Base Bid: 6,000 gp**  
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

This amulet, forged from interwoven rings of black and white jade, resonates with opposing yet complementary energies. While attuned, you can shift between two connected forms: **Yin Aspect** and **Yang Aspect**.

#### **Balance of Duality**

Once per day, as a bonus action, you can **switch aspects**. When you switch, you gain a surge of energy, but your new aspect remains until you switch again.

- **Upon switching into Yin Aspect, you immediately gain:**
    - **Flowing Grace:** +2 Dexterity (to a maximum of 20) for 1 minute.
    - **Evasive Reflexes:** Advantage on Dexterity saving throws and Acrobatics checks for 1 minute.
    - **Ethereal Resilience:** Resistance to cold damage for 1 minute.
- **Upon switching into Yang Aspect, you immediately gain:**
    - **Unyielding Strength:** +2 Strength (to a maximum of 20) for 1 minute.
    - **Enduring Form:** Advantage on Constitution saving throws and Athletics checks for 1 minute.
    - **Burning Spirit:** Resistance to fire damage for 1 minute.
Once the temporary benefits fade, you remain in your chosen aspect **until you switch again** (which you can only do **once per long rest**).
