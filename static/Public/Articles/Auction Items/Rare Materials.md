### **Heart of Shadow**

**Base Bid: 1,250 gp**  
_Wondrous item, rare_

Torn from the chest of a mutated beast, this dark, pulsating organ is a testament to the corrupting influence of shadow magic. Veins of eerie purple energy pulse through the heart's surface, casting an unsettling glow. Those who gaze upon it feel an inexplicable sense of dread, as if the heart itself is a conduit for the malevolent forces that once transformed its original owner. Despite its unnerving appearance, the Heart of Shadow is a sought-after rare material, prized by those who dare to harness its power for their own enigmatic purposes.

### **Netherbreath Fungus**

**Base Bid: 1,000 gp**  
_Wondrous item, rare_

A deep blue fungus born from the abyssal void, where the tides bury all and breath is but a whisper. It binds to the flesh of the lost and lingers in the spaces between life and decay, inhaling what lingers in the air and exhaling unseen spores. Each breath carries the memory of the deep, laced with the quiet pull of the abyss.

### **Serpent’s Molt of the Abyss**

**Base Bid: 4,500 gp**  
_Wondrous item, very rare_

The shed skin of an ancient abyssal serpent, this translucent material shimmers with an unnatural sheen, shifting between deep indigo and iridescent green. It retains the venomous potency of its original owner, exuding a faint, almost intoxicating scent that lingers in the air. Alchemists and poison masters prize the Serpent’s Molt for its ability to enhance toxins, allowing them to weave poisons that adapt to the target’s body, bypassing resistances and lingering long after their initial application. When ground into a fine powder, it is said to bind to the soul, ensuring that its venom remains potent even beyond death.

### **Everheart Root**

**Base Bid: 5,000 gp**  
_Wondrous item, very rare_

A gnarled root said to be the petrified heart of an ancient world tree, pulsing faintly with the rhythms of both life and death. One half of the root is dark and brittle, its surface marked with vein-like cracks oozing a thick, black sap, while the other half remains smooth, exuding a golden warmth that never fades. Those who grasp it feel their own heartbeat synchronizing with its slow, primal thrum. Wood element masters and practitioners of balance within the five elements covet the Everheart Root, believing it embodies the harmony of yin and yang within a living form.
