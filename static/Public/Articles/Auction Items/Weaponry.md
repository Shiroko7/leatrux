### **Starshot Longbow**

**Base Bid: 3,000 gp**  
_Weapon (longbow), rare (requires attunement)_

This elegant longbow is crafted from blackened wood, with pearl inlays depicting constellations along its limbs. You ignore the ammunition property when using this longbow; if you do not load an arrow, the bow automatically creates its own, forming a piece of magical ammunition when you make a ranged attack. The ammunition vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

The bow has **3 charges** and regains **1d3 expended charges** daily at dawn.

#### **Constellations**
As a bonus action, you can tap one of the bowâ€™s constellations to invoke its power, expending 1 charge:
- **Balance.** The next time you hit a creature with a ranged attack before the end of your next turn, you or another creature of your choice within 30 feet regains hit points equal to **1d8 + your proficiency bonus**.
    
- **Flames.** Until the end of your next turn, when you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this bow, the attack deals an additional **2d8 radiant damage**.
    
- **Rogue.** Until the end of your next turn, you gain the **invisible condition**, along with anything you are wearing or carrying.
